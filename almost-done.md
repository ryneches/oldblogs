Summary: 


I took the General GRE yesterday, and two of my three recommenders have
uploaded their letters. I was sure that I had bombed the quantitative
section, so I was flabbergasted to see my score at the end was rather
excellent. Evidently, they really do slip experimental questions into
the test that they don't score. I really appreciate the instant score
report -- it saved me from two weeks of misery.

Now I just have to track down my undergrad ID number to get Northeastern
to cough up my transcripts. It's astonishing how much energy this
process takes, but the hard parts are done.
