Summary: 


I've been working a bit on the software that generates my 96-well
dilution plate. I have a new version that cuts the plastic use by about
80% and print time by about the same. Also, it now prints with the wells
upside-down on the build platform, which should help cut down
contamination during the printing process.

Things to do :

-   I'm going to try cutting the plastic use even more by adding a skirt
    around the plate (like a normal titer plate), and adjusting the
    outer height of each well.
-   Add a fill-line to each well.
-   Raise the well edges a little more, and add drain-holes between
    wells to prevent spillage between wells and to make filling easier.
-   Add embossed row and column labels.
-   Add an embossed text area for user notations (e.g., for which sample
    group is this plate calibrated).

Hmm. I might pull this off yet.

Also, if you are interested in this stuff, the [UC Davis Biomedical
Engineering](http://www.bme.ucdavis.edu/) made me instructor of a
variable unit class (graded P/NP) called "Research internship in
robotics for the laboratory" for Winter 2012. Sign up for BIM192, sec 2
(the CRN is 24791).
