Summary: 


While I listened to Petraeus and Crocker tiptoe clumsily around perjury,
I couldn't help but wonder how many people will take them at their word
that the level of violence is declining. I find it difficult to
understand how the level of violence is decreasing when the rate of
killing has been increasing. I guess it must depend on how you [count
the
bodies](http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/10/26/explosives_were_looted_after_iraq_invasion/).
Evidently, ordinary muggers shoot people in the face, and death squads
shoot people in the back of the head. Accepting, for a moment, this
ridiculous criterion for distinguishing muggings from sectarian killings
as reasonable, it seems very weird that we don't count muggings as
violence.

Ambassador Crocker, for his part, repeated the assertion that Iran is
supplying the insurgency with sophisticated weapons, particularly
[explosively formed
penetrators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosively_formed_penetrator%0A).
If you will direct your attention to the photograph below, from
Wikipedia :

This is a sophisticated weapon that exploits some very tricky
hydrodynamics. It is also *improvised* from an ordinary copper pipe. The
penetrator (the bowl shaped part) looks like it was turned out on a
lathe, and that the machinist was either not very skillful or not very
concerned with quality. Note the disk-shaped depression in the center
where the lathe spindle was attached. The penetrator appears to be
soldered to the pipe with plumbing solder.

I don't think the insurgency needs anyone's help to build these. The
hardest part would be obtaining the explosive material. Who is supplying
the insurgency with explosives? The simplest explanation is that they
helped themselves to the [weapons caches we left unguarded at the
beginning of the
war](http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/10/26/explosives_were_looted_after_iraq_invasion/).
How many improvised explosively formed penetrators could you make with
377 tons of high explosives?

Maybe Iran isn't being very helpful when it comes to American interests
in Iraq. After all, why should they? I have no doubt that Iran's
leadership would be delighted to see things go as badly for America as
possible in Iraq and elsewhere. However, it's not as if Iran actually
has to *do* anything to make Iraq a disaster for America. The fact that
they don't like us is not in itself a very good reason for them to arm
the insurgents. Practically *any* government in Iraq is likely to be
friendly with Iran. Iran actually has a lot of good reasons to want the
insurgency to stop.

If I were Mr. Ahmadinejad, I would just sit on my hands. At most, I
would give some political support to Iraqis who might be friendly to
Iran should they gain or keep power. But weapons? Why bother when the
insurgents have already looted all the weapons they could ever want? It
would be redundant and unnecessary.

Like most Americans, Mr. Crocker knows that we've either lost or that
we're loosing. What sets him apart from the rest of us is that Americans
are grown up enough to accept responsibility for the bad outcome of this
conflict, and Mr. Crocker would rather blame it on someone else.
