Summary: 


After it started to cool down yesterday, I went for a bike ride around
the research farms, and I saw what I thought was a seam in the bike
path. It wasn't until I was almost on top of it that I noticed that it
was the shadow of a snake crossing the path! I ran over the poor guy
before I could hit the breakes.

Fortunately, the snake survived, and went slithering into his hidey hole
in the roots of one of the huge trees that line the bike path. I used a
stick to touch the end of his tail to make sure his spine wasn't broken,
and he reacted in about the way you would expect a not-run-over snake to
react.

Sorry this isn't a very good picture. Since T-Mobile pushed out the
Android Cupcake upgrade, my phone has been ridiculously, pathetically
slow. It took almost a minute and a half to get the camera application
open and snap a picture. By that time, the snake had spent 30 seconds
slithering around on the bike path checking itself out (which would have
been an awesome shot), and then gone about 20 feet into the grass. Boo
Android! Fix your shit!

The snake was about four feet long and about the width of two fingers.
The head was sort of bullet-shaped, as opposed to shovel-shaped, so it's
probably not a viper. My guess is garter snake.
