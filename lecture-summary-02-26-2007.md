Summary: 


Today's was scattering galore. When I got to class, Abers was in the
middle of a long calculation, and I never found out what it was he was
calculating. There were Green's functions involved, so it must have had
something to do with the Born approximation. Poisson and Fresnel were
mentioned as well, and the appearance of the latter name sheds some
light (har har) on the nature impermeable mathematics.

Next, Abers calculated the classical cross section for a sphere (it's
just the cross sectional area of the sphere) and the cross section to
propagating plane wave (four times as big). In the region of small-angle
deflections, the wave equation undergoes constructive interference. Both
calculations is pretty fundamental, so I'll revisit it once I finish the
homework for the variational principle.

**Update:** Here is once case where I am deeply grateful for Abers'
book. His lectures match the book exactly, so if I miss something in
class, I know I can always find it later. My hunch was correct; he
working through the Born series for spherically symmetric potentials.
