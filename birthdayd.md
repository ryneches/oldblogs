Summary: 


How to ring in a birthday: Fresh mushroom soup, some good cheese, fresh
olives, some leftover Chinese food, and a fantastically ostentatious
bottle of Pinot Noir enjoyed with my superlatively wonderful girlfriend.
While watching cartoons.

It doesn't get any better than that. Well, maybe World Peace would be
nice...
