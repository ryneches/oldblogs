Summary: 


I finally got through the double-PCR phase of the protocol without
wrecking something. Yay!

My hacked up version of the gene
[gene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=gene&cmd=search&term=MXAN_7396)
is getting snipped up with everyone's favorite restriction enzymes
(BamH1 and EcoR1). Then I get to splice it into a plasmid, and
electroport the plasmids into some cells, and maybe they will do
something interesing.
