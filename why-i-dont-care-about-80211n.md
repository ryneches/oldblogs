Summary: 


I wish the WiFi Alliance people would stop worrying about the maximum
speed of the 802.11 family of protocols, and instead worry about
improving cooperation among networks. When 802.11b was new and shiny, it
was fairly unlikely that you'd have to worry about spectrum competition.
Now, wherever you are likely to find one network, you are likely to find
a dozen.

Usually, this kind of mess happens in residential areas, but I've seen
it lab buildings also. I would be more than happy to route a few of my
neighbor's packets on my network in exchange for less spectrum
congestion. What is needed here is a protocol that would allow owners of
clashing access points to decide who they are friends with.

Of course, this would mean that anyone who owned an access point would
have to be able to assert common carrier status, which could have some
interesting side effects.
