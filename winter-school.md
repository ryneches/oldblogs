Summary: 


This week's lesson: If you know anything about computers, and your boss
doesn't know it, *under no circumstances should you allow them to find
out!*

This week is the [Winter
School](http://cmpd.physics.ucla.edu/winterschool.html). Third day, and
I think I've heard about as much about magnetic reconnection as I can
absorb.
