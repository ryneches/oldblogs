Summary: 


Much to my disappointment, Ophidian is dead in its tracks. The root
finder is searching for the roots very close to a singularity, and the
median distance between the root and the singularity scales with beta.
That means that as I work my way down in beta, the convergence goes to
hell.

Steve and I are going to look at this tomorrow and see if we can arrange
the system of equations in a way that puts the roots farther away from
the singularities. Or, since I have five clean high-beta cases and some
busted low-beta cases, I might have enough to finish the paper as it
stands now.

In any event, I've pretty much had enough of this problem.
