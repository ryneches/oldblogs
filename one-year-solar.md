Summary: 


A little more than a year ago, my mother [installed 14 SunPower 230 watt
panels on her
roof](http://vort.org/2008/06/04/first-day-solar-production/). After a
year of production, my mom's solar array has produced 5.3 megawatt-hours
of electricity. That's about \$1500 worth of electricity production.

Her actual use was about 3 mwh, yielding a surplus of about 2 mwh over
the year. Rock on! Pasadena Water & Power won't actually write a check
for the balance, but are carrying it forward indefinitely. Eventually, I
suppose, they will figure out a way for her to cash in. I figure that
someday she will be able to buy an electric car, and the extra
production (plus the surplus stashed away in her utility bill) will go
toward charging it.

Before installing the panels, she had whittled her electricity usage
from about [32 kwh a day down to about
13](http://vort.org/2007/11/25/killing-the-watts/). I thought it would
be interesting to see the how things look now.

I decided to invert the Y-axis to represent net energy balance from the
homeowner's point of view. Negative numbers represent net consumption,
positive numbers are net production. The green region indicates the
interval since the panels were installed. PWD bills on a bi-monthly
basis, so unfortunately there are not very many data points.

The panels were installed in the middle of a billing period, so the
first data point lifts away from the prior trend, and settles on a new
trend. The third point in the green region -- the one that dips back
into the negative -- is the middle of winter. Production was lowest, and
my mom was running a space heater at her desk to keep her feet warm.
