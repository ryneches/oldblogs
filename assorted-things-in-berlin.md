Summary: 


Mimi and I took a walking tour of Berlin, and one of the stops was the
site where Adolf Hitler died. Berlin has decided to honor this spot by
building a parkinglot on it. This yellow traffic control gate marks the
very spot where he expired.

I think it ought to be officially named the Adolf Hitler Memorial
Parking Lot. The ruins of the bunker underneath could become the Hitler
Memorial Septic Tank.
