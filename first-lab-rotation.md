Summary: 


Now that I have a free moment between chopping potatoes and mashing
them, I figure I should post the paper and talk I wrote summarizing my
first lab rotation.

I tried to make the
[paper](http://vort.org/media/papers/rotation_1_neches.pdf) look like an
PNAS article, but alas, their LaTeX template leaves much to be desired.
I like how the [talk](http://vort.org/media/papers/rotation_1_talk.pdf)
turned out little better, thanks the wonderful
[Beamer](http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/) package for LaTeX.
