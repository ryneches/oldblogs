Summary: 


I was wondering how we'll know when the credit crisis is over, and I
thought I'd share my gloomyness with you, dear readers.

The Big Money people invested vast amounts of capital in malls and
condominiums, and now they have to come to terms with the fact that
these things are not productive assets. All of that capital was blown on
green lawns and shiny baubles, instead of invested in equipment and
training. Now the capital is gone, with nothing to show for it but a
bunch of luxury stucco boxes in the desert with no schools, no jobs and
no water rights.

You'll know we're near the end of it when they start bulldozing
abandoned subdivisions and planned communities. That's the reality of
the situation; we built too much housing, we built housing of the wrong
type, at the wrong size and scale, with the wrong materials and the
wrong technologies, and we built it in the wrong places. Until Americans
face that reality, the financial system will stay broken. But once the
bulldozers get to work, you can be pretty sure that the reckoning is
underway, and the stock prices you see are close to honest.

The metric for recovery that I'm keeping in my head is this; when it
becomes profitable in Southern California to buy up a bunch of crappy
houses, tear them down, plant some orange trees, and sell the oranges,
then we're good.
