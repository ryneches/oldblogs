Summary: 


The student affairs officer at UC Davis said that there are possibly
some TA fellowships still available from other departments. I want to
make sure I get one, so I'm jumping in my car and driving to up to Davis
with a couple of crumpled bills in my pocket, a shopping bag of canned
soup, and an empty bank account.

Ah, adventure! I'll try not to get *E. coli* poisoning this time.
