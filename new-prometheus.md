Summary: 


One year ago, UC Davis law student [Megan Glanville was
killed](http://www.davisenterprise.com/local-news/crime-fire-courts/woman-hit-by-truck-in-west-davis/)
a stone's throw from my front door. She was crossing the street for a
morning run. It was foggy. The driver didn't see her.

Since then, the intersection where she died has been redesigned. It is
now a three-way stop with modern LED lighting. Watching over the scene,
there is a new flashing red beacon.

This sort of infrastructure is easy to take for granted. As a
[Commissioner for the City of
Davis](http://city-council.cityofdavis.org/commissions/safety-and-parking-advisory-commission),
I suppose I pay closer attention to these things that most people do.
I've payed particular attention to this little piece of city
infrastructure because I pass through it several times a day.

Something has changed there since the red beacon went up. Up and down
the boulevard, for almost a mile, there are crossings to access the
bicycle path. Drivers now stop and let me cross. They *never* did that
before. I am not exaggerating when I say that wherever the beacon's
light falls, the feel of the street has changed. It's no longer the tail
end of a lonely country road. It's a neighborhood street, and people act
accordingly.

I would like to think that drivers feel the significance of the flashing
beacon. I would like to think that they have noticed that the
intersection has been redesigned. I would like to think that they know
that Megan Glanville died there. In all likelihood, they are oblivious
to these things. They stop and smile and waive me through anyway.

Why?

Good design matters. That's why.

On a superficial level, a flashing red beacon is a utilitarian thing. If
you look more closely, you will see that it is also a thing of beauty.
It is an avatar of the compulsion we all feel to protect, to warn, to
guide. The humble beacon is one of the better angels of our nature,
sculpted with massive limbs of galvanized steel and eyes of electrically
exuberant gallium phosphide. It sends our message out into the world,
again, and again, and again.
