Summary: 


This idea has probably been floated before, but it occurs to me that
there is a very simple plan for getting us out of Iraq: Hold a national
referendum in Iraq on whether or not to continue the occupation. If the
Iraqis tell us to get out, then we should get out. Immediately.

The Republican position seems to be that we have to stay in Iraq to
protect its "young democracy," as the president described it yesterday.
There could hardly be a more democratic way of settling this question.
On the other hand, a referendum is almost sure to result in a resounding
"Get Out."

If the Democratic Party is looking for a nice, reasonable,
uncontroversial plan for getting out of Iraq, I can't see how this one
could be attacked. We're ostensibly in Iraq for its own good. If we're
not wanted, then we ought to withdraw. No one could call it cutting and
running if we are asked to leave.
