Summary: 


A few months ago, I tweeted, "I've been working in a microbiology lab
for two years, and just realized we don't actually have a microscope.
Huh."

[Jack Gilbert](https://twitter.com/#!/gilbertjacka) and some other
people proceeded to give me grief for what I intended as an interesting
observation about the current state of the art in microbiology. So, I
decided to remedy the situation. Evidently, we *do* have a microscope, I
just didn't know where it was.

Here are some cool things I found by randomly poking around in some of
my samples from Borax Lake. This first thing I found is probably some
kind of diatom from in the sediment of the little hot spring just north
of Borax Lake. I'm not looking for diatoms, but it looks really, really
cool.

Here they are at 100x magnification.

This is somewhat less cool-looking, but is probably what I'm actually
looking for. In the little bubble of water surrounding the granule in
the center, there were a couple little rods hopping around. No clue what
they are, they're there, doing what they do.
