Summary: 


It looks like the New York Times was seriously shocked by Sunday's news.
So shocked, it seems, that that they left grammatical errors all over
their [headline story about Lehman
Brothers](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/business/15lehman.html) :

> A.I.G. will be the next test. Ratings agencies threatened to downgrade
> A.I.G.'s credit rating if it does not raise \$40 billion by Monday
> morning, a step that would ***crippled*** the company. A.I.G. had
> hoped to shore itself up, in ***party*** by selling certain
> businesses, but potential bidders, including the private investment
> firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and TPG, withdrew at the last minute
> because the government refused to provide a financial guarantee for
> the purchase. A.I.G. rejected an offer by another investor, J. C.
> Flowers & Company.

I think the copy editors must have been on the phone to their brokers.
