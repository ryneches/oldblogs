Summary: 


Here's my ballot for the 2008 California Democratic primary. As you can
see, I voted for Obama. I hope you will vote for whoever you feel would
be the best nominee, but some people may be intersted to hear my reasons
for voting as I have.

### Why I Won't Vote for Hillary

Hillary's campaign has focused relentlessly on one theme: Experience.
She's been fighting for middle-class Americans for a long time,
particularly on the subject of health care. People who don't like her
have tried to minimize Hillary's role in the Clinton White House; they
evidently don't remember the 1990s. The trouble is not that I don't
think she has the experience, it's that I'm not particularly impressed
by her accomplishments.

That's a pretty sweeping assertion, so let me offer the most important
example of what I am talking about. The touchstone moment of Hillary
Clinton's tenure in the White House was the introduction of the health
care package. At the time, it was clear that health care was in crisis,
and the plan assembled by the Clinton White House under Hillary's
supervision probably would have more-or-less ended the crisis. I'm not
going to claim that it would have been a great system, or that it was a
wonderful piece of legislation, but it was clearly a bold step in the
right direction. Unfortunately, the bill failed, and it failed so
spectacularly that it hobbled Bill Clinton's domestic agenda even after
his successful reelection.

Why did it fail? It failed for a lot of reasons, but here are the ones
that stick in my mind :

*   It was a *gigantic* piece of legislation, more than a thousand pages
    of dense legal jargon. I still remember the news clips of
    Congressional aides setting out copies of the bill on overloaded,
    buckling folding tables. There was no hope whatsoever that an
    ordinary person, even a very motivated one, could have learned
    enough about the bill to understand it on its merits.
*   The bill was produced in secret. The Association of American
    Physicians and Surgeons even went as far as to *sue* the Health Care
    Task Force to find out what was happening in the closed meetings.
    They were drafting legislation that would change the whole health
    care system, and they shut out the doctors. Dumb, dumb, dumb.
*   The plan itself was a hideous chimera; the idea was to take the
    scenario under which most Americans obtain health care coverage
    (i.e., from their employer), make it mandatory. Then, there was a
    system of price controls, and various other administrative
    thingamajigs... In short, it lacked any kind of unity of vision that
    would have allowed the Clintons to articulate how it was supposed to
    work.
*   The Task Force deliberated for a very long time to excrete this
    gorgon of a proposal, and by the time it was out in the open, the
    initial enthusiasm and excitement had evaporated. The bill's opponents
    had a nice, long time to organize their attack. The attack went off
    like clockwork, and Newt and his cronies rode the momentum of this
    attack into the 1994 elections and seized control of Congress. The
    Clinton's didn't just loose the health care bill, they lost *every*
    bill that could have been promulgated to a Democratic Congress.

Universal health care is a pretty grand endeavor. You'd have to look at
the Social Security Act to find a piece of legislation with a similar
breadth and scope, so let's take a peek at the Social Security Act of
1935. It represented a historic change in the relationship between
citizens and government, but the legislation is [only a few dozen pages
long](http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?doc=68&page=transcript). It
doesn't take long to read, and an ordinary person can pretty much follow
what most of the bill does.

The original act has been updated several times since the program was
created, but the original legislation completely captured the theory,
practice and most of the essential features of the program. It was
fairly simple, it was astonishingly efficient (even before computers),
and it works.

Hillary's health care bill didn't fail because the nasty Republicans
killed it. It failed because it was a murky tangle of legal
spaghetti-code constructed in secret under dubious circumstances and
championed by a callous, tardy and tone-deaf technocrat.

Hillary claims that she's learned from her mistakes. On a personal
level, I'm more than happy to forgive her. I think she made an earnest
effort to do something good for a lot of people. However, the fact
remains that we've seen Hillary spearhead a major legislative effort,
and she did just about the worst job you could possibly imagine.

There are a lot of people who are very excited about the prospect of a
female president. I think it would be pretty great, actually. On the
other hand, she is running for *president*. You don't put someone in
that office because you like them and think they deserve your loyalty.
You put them in that office because you want them to do a good job,
period. The presidency is not a reward; it is a duty. It should be given
to person best able to peform that duty, and Hillary has an established
record of arrogance and poor decisions.

Women have fought for a long time to be taken seriously in the
workplace, in academia, and in politics. I take Hillary seriously, and I
seriously don't want her to be president. She clearly has the brains and
the grit to be president, but then again, I don't think she's
particularly unique among women in that regard. There are millions of
women who could competently serve in the capacity of President of the
United States. There are women out there doing much harder jobs.

The Clinton campaign mantra is that Hillary is experienced. Yep, she
certainly has lots of experience fighting for good, worthy things. On
the other hand, she also has a conspicuously inauspicious track record
when it comes to *accomplishing* these good, worthy things. She and her
husband presided over the Democratic Party's most devastating
legislative failure of the 20th century. I don't see why we, as voters,
should reward failure.

Since then, Hillary has managed to help precipitate a number of other
spectacular legislative failures :

*   Voted to authorize the Iraq war
*   Voted for the PATRIOT act (twice)
*   Voted to confirm John Roberts

On the Other hand, we've got Barack Obama. Mr. Obama might not have
quite as impressive a resume as Mrs. Clinton, but

1.  he is nevertheless an astonishingly accomplished individual and
2.  he has never done anything to wreck the Democratic Party.

Both Obama and Clinton are clearly competent to hold the office --
especially in contrast with its current occupant. Mr. Obama is more
charismatic, though I thik more has been made of this point than it
deserves. The reason I am voting for him is that of the candidates on
the ballot, he is the one with the best record of good decision making.
I don't agree with everything Mr. Obama says -- I emphatically agree
with Paul Krugman on the topic of mandates -- but I think Mr. Obama is
the most likely candidate to actually *deliver* a health care package.
Mr. and Mrs. Clinton had their chance, and they blew it.
