Summary: 


I've adopted two kittens! They were captured with their mother in a
feral cat colony out in the farmland somewhere around Davis. As much as
I love cats, feral cats are a terrible ecological problem; they eat
their way through the native bird population astonishingly quickly. The
mother is supposed to be a champion huntress, which is kind of bad. She
is too wild to become a house-cat, but fortunately not wild enough that
she would have to be put down. Evidently she's been spayed, and will
eventually gain employment as an official rodent control officer at a
farm or vineyard, safely away from nesting areas.

However, I have a problem. I don't know what to name them! They have
provisional names, but they're already growing out of them. They are
brothers, so I'd like to name them accordingly. If you know any good
names of brothers, or brothers-in-arms, from history or literature,
please post below.

Candidate names are :

-   Buzz and Neil
-   Romulus and Remus
-   Castor and Pollux
-   Lio and Erasmus
-   Watson and Crick
-   Wilbur and Orville
-   Yuri and Glenn

I tried to think of some characters from Shakespeare, but most of the
brothers in the plays murder each other, or do other dastardly deeds.
Not very fitting for these two guys. They are just about the least
mischievous kittens I've ever met. The worst they do to each other is to
induce unwanted consciousness via squirming.
