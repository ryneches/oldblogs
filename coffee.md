Summary: 


As everyone who knows me has learned, I love coffee. It's just about one
of my favorite things. I've been enjoying it since my dad decided to
accelerate the rather annoying process of dissolving coco powder into
milk by dissolving it in a shot of his morning coffee. I was about for
or five years old, and I've loved it ever since. By the time I was in
fourth grade, the fraction of milk in my coffee declined to zero, where
it's stayed.

So, no surprise that I'm bringing an espresso machine :
