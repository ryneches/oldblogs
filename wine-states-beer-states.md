Summary: 


I was playing around with Google Lab's latest nifty gizmo, [Google
Correlate](http://correlate.googlelabs.com/), and came across this
interesting little tuft of statistical ephemera. Here is the
distribution of searches for
"[wine](http://correlate.googlelabs.com/search?e=wine&t=all)" verses
"[beer](http://correlate.googlelabs.com/search?e=beer&t=all)" across US
states.

I suppose that's... basically what I expected. I thought this would be a
nice little homage to the 35th anniversary of the [Judgement of
Paris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_of_Paris_(wine)), the event
which catapulted California wines out of unpopular obscurity and onto
the world scene (and is also a beautifully wry [literary
allusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgement_of_Paris)).
