Summary: 


I've been puzzling over how to go about manipulating the NEF RAW images
my camera produces. Obviously, it is better in principle to shoot in RAW
than in JPEG, but the tools for editing RAW files under Linux do not
seem to be very far along. For example, The Gimp doesn't natively
support them. But that isn't to say there are *no* tools.
[Rawstudio](http://rawstudio.org/) provides pretty solid toolbox of
basic manipulations. I can finally fix up the colors in some of my
favorite shots.

Now, if only I had some good way of doing
[demosaicing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demosaicing), I'd be all set.
