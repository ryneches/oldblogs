Summary: 


[Dr. Robert Lustig](http://www.chc.ucsf.edu/coast/faculty_lustig.htm%0A)
at UCSF gave a [very interesting public
lecture](%0Ahttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM) for
[UCTV](http://www.uctv.tv/) on the relationship between sugar
consumption and a host of health problems, ranging from obesity to
diabetes to gout. I won't reiterate his argument, but the kernel is that
he has bestowed the term "poison" on fructose. By "poison," he means
poison in the same sense that alcohol is a poison. Fructose and ethanol
are both chemicals that causes health problems, and that only the liver
handle. Keep in mind that if the body were a city, the liver would be
the part of town with the scary industrial stuff, all pipes and loud
noises smokestacks and funny smells.

In the lecture, he suggests that *fruit* isn't necessarily bad, because
fruit tends to come along with fiber, and fiber slows down the rate at
which the sugar hits your blood. This gives your gut microflora a chance
to get at it and metabolize it into less harmful compounds (though with
the unfortunate but health-neutral side effect of flatulence).

Anyway, this got me wondering. Which sugars are in which fruit? Not all
sugars, or fruits, are equal. So, here's a nice chart I made from some
data I found somewhere on the internet.

I computed the ranking by generating a "badness" index as follows :

$$\text{badness}=\frac{\text{fructose}+\frac{1}{2}\text{sucrose}}{\text{glucose}+\text{fructose}+\text{sucrose}+\text{maltose}+\text{galactose}}$$

It makes me a little sad to see apples, pears and mangos down there at
the bottom, though I'm delighted to see avocados at the top. Also, I
would like to remind you that not everything that is quantitative is
scientific, and making a nice chart of some data you find on a [random
web
page](http://www.thepaleodiet.com/nutritional_tools/fruits_table.html)
is certainly not scientific.
