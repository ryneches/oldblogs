Summary: 


Like coal and gas power stations, nuclear power plants are heat engines.
They produce power by exploiting the difference in temperature between
two heat reservoirs. When most people think of a nuclear power plant (or
any heat engine, really) the component that naturally dominates one's
attention is the hot reservoir -- the reactor. The reactor contains most
of the clever science and engineering, so it commands attention. But it
takes *two* reservoirs of comparable heat capacity to make a heat
engine.

Surprisingly, though, the electricity production of a given power plant
is usually not limited by the reactor. We know how to build staggeringly
enormous reactors, and even small reactors can be designed to run
extremely hot. Rather, the generating capacity is limited by the heat
capacity of the cold reservoir, which is a function of the natural
environment in which the power station is situated. Nuclear reactors are
cooled by water, so the generating capacity of a nuclear power plant is
directly proportional to the quantity and temperature of water available
from the environment.

So, what happens when there is a drought? Or a heat wave? Or both? The
heat capacity of the cold reservoir shrinks, and the generating capacity
of the power plant shrinks with it. It doesn't matter how big and fancy
the reactor is if there isn't enough cooling water.

The water in the Tennessee River has gotten so hot this summer -- more
than 90 degrees Fahrenheit averaged over a day -- that the TVA was
forced to [shut down one of the reactors at Browns
Ferry](http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/energy/5061439.html).
The heat capacity of their cold reservoir has shrunk so much that they
can only operate two of their three reactors. The TVA is already
suffering from reduced production at their hydroelectric stations due to
drought conditions.

The lesson here is that nuclear power isn't simply a solution to global
warming. It a technology that is *threatened* by global warming.
