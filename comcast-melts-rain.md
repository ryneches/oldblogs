Summary: 


For reasons I do not wish to fathom, my internet connection from home
sucks whenever it rains. When I try to imagine why this might be the
case, it calls to mind some truly horrifying images of what might be
going on in Comcast's wiring closets.

How much does it suck? Well, here is a histogram of 200 ping times from
my house to a machine at UC Davis, about 3000 feet from my front door.
For comparison, I simultaneously collected 200 pings from my colo
machine, which is 3000 miles away in Boston. The inbound and outbound
packets from the colo go over Level3, so I've labeled it thusly.

Now, I wouldn't really expect a residential cable modem connection to
measure up very well against a colocated server in terms of latency, but
this isn't just a failure to measure up. This is just a regular old
fashioned failure.

What ticks me off the most is that I pay \$636 a year for this crap, and
that my only alternative is AT&T DSL. I'd rather shave my tongue with a
used bayonet than see a penny of my income fall into the hands of AT&T.
Why does broadband suck in America?
