Summary: 


My apologies for getting behind on posting my updates from Uzon. After
we returned from Uzon, we rested for a day, and then crammed ourselves
and our equipment into a van and went to
[Peratunka](http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B0_(%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BE))
for the Biodiversity, Molecular Biology and Biogeochemistry of
Thermophiles international workshop, where I was scheduled to give a 20
minute talk.

The speaking docket got shuffled around a lot, and I ended up having to
give my talk much earlier than planned. I suppose this is the inevitable
downside of procrastination. While I was scrambling to finish it, I
didn't have much time for blog updates!

I survived the talk. There were lots and lots of excellent questions,
and I have a lot to think about now. Anyway, back to the updates from
Uzon.
