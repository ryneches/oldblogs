Summary: 


My 70 euro worth of Vodafone minutes was expended in a 3 minute call to
Steve, which was the very first call I made with the stupid thing. And I
can't use my VoIP box because I don't have WiFi, and in any event, I
forgot a UK power adapter, so I can't plug the damn thing in anyway.

I had a super-uber rotten flight. I don't think I'm ever going to fly
Ryan Air after this trip. They don't even let you have water without
paying 6 euro. And they blair advertisements at you the the whole way.
And take collections for asorted Irish charities. And my skull felt like
it was being sweezed in a vice, until I got tunnel vision from the pain,
and then the sqeezing just turned into general agony. And the guy next
to me was a talkative New Zelander who kept making dirty Jew jokes.

Then I got to Luton, and bought the first edible object I found, which
turned out to be a tiny tuna sandwich and a bottle of water (there's no
potable drinking water at the airport). It was 14 pounds. *14 pounds.*

Then Steve gave me wrong directions, and I walked the length and bredth
of Hyde Park looking for him. Nice place, but not while running a fever
(again). Then I wasted some more time discovering that six out of seven
phone booths in the city seem to be broken, and then had to pay 4 pounds
for another 3 minute conversation.

The good news is that Steve is putting me up at a special flat for
visiting professors (just until Monday). It's right on Hyde Park, next
to the Science Museum. It's beautiful, much nicer than Savoy. Private
kitchen, laundry, lounge, balcony (overlooking the park), plus squash
courts, pool, et cetera. Unfortunately, London is not completely
obsessed with "security", so you need a damn key card to do anything in
the building, and the stupid security system doesn't work right, and
every time I go outside the flat I set off ten different alarms. I press
down button on elevator, whooping sirens. I bump into a protruding light
fixture, set off screeching claxons. Guards come running with hands on
guns, babes cry, small children snicker at me. Et cetera. It's like
something out of a movie.

Then I found a pub and ate some fish and chips and three pints of ale,
and felt better.
