Summary: 


The contractors installed the last row of panels this morning and
switched on our solar array. Our house now produces about 15% more
electricity than it uses!

The array produces between one and three kilowatt-hours for every hour
of sunlight, so for today's half-day of production, we've generated 13
kwh.

Here's the read-out on the inverter :

Sadly, I don't have a way of getting the data out of the inverter yet.
Once I add the RS-232 module, I'll have have more interesting things to
say about our system. I'll post some pictures of the array itself once
we've passed inspection.

The Sunny Boy inverter has an interesting user interface. There aren't
any buttons -- you interact with the display by knocking on the front
panel with your knuckle.
