Summary: 


From the moment it became clear that the stated reasons were both
manifestly ridiculous and demonstrably false, petabytes have been
devoted to speculation about the "real" reason why the United States
invaded Iraq. They range from "'everyone' believed that there were
WMDs..." to simply "the oil." Thus far, I have found no explanation that
is particularly compelling, so I've left the question unanswered in my
mind.

That is, until [The Editors provided
one](http://www.thepoorman.net/2007/08/24/fuck-the-dog/) that can
turn aside old Occam's Razor. Of course it's speculation. However, since
even the best friends of the White House can only speculate on what goes
on in there, speculate is all we can do. This administration is a black
box. Well, a black box from which leaks a steady drip of incompetence
and malfeasance, but a black box nonetheless. I suspect that even with
the benefit of historical perspective, the academic study of early 21st
Century American History will do no better on this topic than
speculating on the circumstantial evidence.

The Editors offer what I consider the first successful sally in this
endeavor. If it's anywhere close to true, then I think its profanity is
completely justified.
