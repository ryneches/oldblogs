Summary: 


This summer has turned out a bit like a chocolate bar in the sun;
everything started out nice and neat, but everything ended up squished
into the bottom of the wrapper.

Right now, I'm working with [Andrey
Kislyuk](http://topaz.gatech.edu/~kislyuk/) on our little piece of the
DARPA
[FunBio](http://www.darpa.mil/dso/thrusts/math/funmath/fundamental/index.htm)
project. We're in the middle of a two-week code sprint, so I'll save
that for a later post.

I also moved to a new apartment, and that didn't go nearly as smoothly
as it could have. The guy we subleased from was in the process of buying
a house, and the loan underwriter decided to yank back the money after
he'd closed escrow (or was in escrow, or something). Evidently they
wanted a sworn affidavit from the gardener that he was contracted to
take care of the grounds. Anyway, the upshot was that instead of a nice
leisurely move, he got stuck in the apartment for three weeks longer
than he expected, and I was homeless for a week. Fortunately, one of the
staff scientists in our lab was generous enough to let me stay at his
apartment. Neil and Buzz got to learn about stairs, which they evidently
adore.

Over Labor Day weekend, I went with Srijak and some of his friends from
San Diego on a day hike at Lassen Volcanic National Park. I've always
loved California, but it's nice to be reminded from time to time exactly
why I love this place so much.

Because it's *awesome*.
