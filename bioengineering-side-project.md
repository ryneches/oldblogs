Summary: 


I've been working on a little bioengineering side project, and I just
finished putting together a working version of the firmware. It'll
probably take some refinement, but I've managed to get the
microcontroller to do what I need it to do -- measure visible light
irradiance over a wide range of intensities.

This is the light intensity in microwatts per square centimeter measured
at about a 0.3 second resolution. I haven't done any of the actual bio-
part of the bioengineering, so for the moment the light curve is the
beginnings of a sunset at [Mishka's cafe](http://www.mishkascafe.com/).

I'll post more about this once I have the prototype working. Next up, 3D
printing!
