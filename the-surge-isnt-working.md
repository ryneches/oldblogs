Summary: 


Charles Boustany turned up on CNN to peddle the administration's latest
outrage -- that the surge has reduced violence in Iraq substantially.
So, [Wolf Blitzer asks a hard
question](http://thinkprogress.org/2007/09/02/boustany-iraq/) :

> BOUSTANY: We're clearly seeing some major improvements. Clearly in the
> Anbar Province, we've seen significant improvement. We were able to
> walk the streets of Fallujah. **Sectarian deaths are down.**
>
> [...]
>
> <p>
> BLITZER: And Congressman Boustany, you say that the number of
> casualties is going down. But we took a closer look - and The Los
> Angeles Times did as well - citing Iraqi Health Ministry numbers. In
> June, it was 1,227 civilian deaths in Iraq. In July, it went up to
> 1,753 civilian deaths in Iraq. And in August, the month that just
> ended, 1,773 civilian deaths in Iraq. **Those numbers are going in the
> wrong direction.**

Ah, the *numbers*. It is rather alarming how often important news comes
without any specific discussion of the numbers upon which it hinges.
Someone needs to send Mr. Blitzer a pundit-snack. Good pundit.

But reading a triad of four digit numbers from a teleprompter (or maybe
even from memory) is not the best way to communicate about numbers. That
might be appropriate for MegaMillions, but we owe these particular
numbers more careful examination. We are, after all, talking about the
deaths of human beings as a direct result of our collective decisions at
the ballot box.

So, I [looked up the data](http://www.iraqbodycount.org/database/) on
*conformed* killings of Iraqi civilians. Against the background of men
and women and children turning up as abandoned corpses on the street,
there are a lot of mass-casualty events. There are also a few rare days
when there are no confirmed killings. It's somewhat difficult to see the
trend in the raw data. So, I borrowed an analytical tool from the
financial world -- the moving average.

That looks like a slight upward trend to me. The [GAO
agrees](http://thinkprogress.org/2007/09/04/gao-report-iraq/). Their
data measures the number of attacks, rather than the number of dead, but
one would expect attacks and deaths to correlate.

General Patreous is going to make his presentation in a few days, which
everyone assumes is going to say that the surge is working. If it
doesn't explain these numbers, then the report should be ignored.
