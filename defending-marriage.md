Summary: 


Here is my proposal for a Defense of Marriage act that would, you know,
actually defend marriage:

> "In the eyes of the government and courts of California, marriage
> shall be hereby defined as *none of its goddamned business.*"

If gay people are ever allowed to get married in California, it won't be
by convincing straight people to care. That isn't to say that straight
people don't care; 2,909,370 people voted against Proposition 22. Gay
people will win the right to marry when straight people start getting
uncomfortable about having the government rummaging around in their
married life. Then gay people and straight people can rally behind the
same slogan: *It's none of your goddamned business*. A proudly American
sentiment.

Democrats reflexively package their arguments in the terms of wonderful
programs and insightful social policy. This isn't going to work for
these kinds of issues. Most straight people still feel uncomfortable
about actively supporting a policy that will lead to men kissing other
men on TV. But most straight people probably *would* support a policy
that would grant them a little more freedom and privacy.

From there, it's easy. Americans will generally be comfortable reasoning
that what other people do with their privacy and freedom is their own
damn business. It's simply a matter of framing the debate in such a way
that the bible thumpers are bossing "regular people" around.
