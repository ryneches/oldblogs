Summary: 


The upper atmosphere was pretty think with smoke today, though I don't
see any ash falling in Pasadena or near UCLA. [500,000 people have been
ordered to
evacuate](http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-fire23oct23,0,5337099.story)
from what may be the worst outbreak of fire in California history. A
constellation of fires are burning from Santa Barbara to the US-Mexico
border.

There aren't enough firefighters, and, as has been the case for a long
time now, much of California's National Guard is in Iraq. [The Guard
that is still here is also missing a lot of vehicles and
equipment](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/05/07/eveningnews/main2772124.shtml),
because the equipment is in Iraq now, or because it was destroyed in
Iraq. The Guvonator had to order 200 guardsmen away from patrolling the
US-Mexico border, and people's homes are still burning without a
firefighter or a guardsman in sight.

For those readers outside of California who are chalking this up to the
various "natural" disasters for which California is famous, I'd like to
offer a little explanation. Southern California is a *desert*.
Specifically, it is biotic system called
[chaparral](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Chaparral.jpg).
Normally, it looks sort of like this :

![](http://vort.org/media/images/Chaparral.jpg)

The land is loosely covered with scrubby sagebrush and small, knotted
trees. Small clumps of grasses or wildflowers grow here and there, but
mostly the surface is exposed rock. There is almost no water whatsoever.
One of the peculiar features of this kind of land is that *it is
supposed to burn*. Chaparral plants evaporate volatile oils --
turpentine -- into the air to encourage fires. This is why Chaparral
smells so nice, and why it fucking burns all the time.

So, the problem is this: What kind of idiot would build a house in the
middle of a place that is supposed to **burn to the ground every four of
five years**? The answer is that it isn't the idiots, it's the assholes.
The people who built those houses (and whole towns, in many cases) knew
*exactly* what was going to happen. But they slapped the houses together
and sold them to regular folks looking for a place to live. They've been
doing this for a hundred years.

For the New Englanders who read this blog, think of it this way. Rivers
are supposed to flood periodically, usually into special areas called
floodplanes. These areas have plants and animals that are adapted to
life in a place that floods from time to time. In fact, many of them
would die if there weren't floods. We know all this. Nevertheless,
people still build houses in floodplanes. Usually, though, the home
owner isn't the one at fault. They just moved in, and then one year,
their house floods, and everyone says, "You idiot, you built your house
in a floodplane."

Well, chaparral is sort of the same thing. Instead of a floodplane, it's
a fireplane. It's a really, really stupid place to build a house.

But of course, the homeowner didn't build anything. Usually, a gigantic
multinational corporation, like KB Home, is responsible for developing
the site. No, you say, no developer would *knowingly* build in a
floodplane, or in a fireplane, or some other obviously dangerous place.
Allow me to direct your attention to [one of their developments in
Arlington,
Texas](http://dallas.bizjournals.com/dallas/stories/2001/11/05/daily52.html)

They built homes on top of *fucking bombs*, and then sold them to people
without telling them. So, do you think they have any qualms about
selling people homes in floodplanes, chaparral, and hurricane highways?

Now, I'm not against building homes or against multinational
corporations building them. However, it is worth noting that if my IBM
ThinkPad exploded and burned into a cinder because the battery charging
circuit was defective, no one would be shocked or surprised if I
expected IBM to replace my laptop with one that doesn't explode. Houses
placed in unstable locations are defective. Whoever built them should be
expected to replace them with houses that *aren't* defective. If we held
companies like KB Home to the same standards we hold Apple and IBM, then
we wouldn't be evacuating 500,000 from regions that are naturally
supposed to burn.
