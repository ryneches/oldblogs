Summary: 


You know you're a dork when the *spam* you get pegs you for a science
person. For example, a recent unsolicited missive in my mailbox begins

> Dear Researcher,
> 
> Do you work with integral membrane proteins? Are you trying to identify
> novel protein interactions as part of your research?
>
> We specialize in developing innovative screening systems to help you
> identify new binding partners of your protein of interest. Please take a
> look at our technologies below:
> 
> Custom Yeast Two-Hybrid Screening Services
> 
> Easy & quick: send us the cDNA encoding the protein to be screened and
> select a cDNA library. We perform a complete yeast two-hybrid screen and
> deliver the results to you within 3-4 months!
>
> ...

It continues at length. You know what the worst thing is? I read most of
it, and I was somewhat interested until it occured to me that this is
just well-targeted spam.
