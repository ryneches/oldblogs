My friend [Pete](http://vodun.org/) is in town visiting from our the
capitol of our Great Nation today. He's never been to *El Pueblo de
Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora la Reina de los &Aacute;ngeles sobre El R&iacute;o Porciuncula*, so we
spent a few hours driving around and looking at stuff. On the way back,
I snapped this picture overlooking the Valley. Not bad, considering I
didn't have a tripod handy.
