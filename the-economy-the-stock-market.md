Summary: 


The Dow had [its worst day since the September 11th
attacks](http://news.yahoo.com/;_ylt=AqHeoy86vTbSUY5TIn.aOoJv24cA)
today, falling 416 points following a major correction in the China's
stock markets. This is a good time to remember something that reporters
and politicians often forget: *The economy isn't the stock market*.

For several years, the stock market has been booming while most
Americans are facing increasingly worse financial situations. In 2006,
the personal savings rate went negative for [the second year in a
row](http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_10/b4024037.htm?chan=rss_topStories_ssi_5)
-- something that hasn't happened since the Great Depression. Every time
Bush talks about the economy recently, he tells us how the economy is
"strong." Piffle. The economy might be growing, but it is anything but
strong. "Growing but extremely fragile" is a more accurate
characterization.

Nevertheless, when the stock market has a shock, the axiom still holds.
The stock market isn't the economy. Bad news on Wall Street might
actually be a good thing for America right now. It's about time that the
rich and powerful catch a gust of the ill winds that have been ravishing
America's poor and middle class. Maybe they will put down their cognac
long enough to help us do something about it.
