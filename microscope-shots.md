Summary: 


My mom is doing some species survey work for the Navy, and got
interested in these insanely tiny [Chalcid
wasps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcid_wasp). Some of them are
smaller than a grain of sand wingtip-to-wingtip, so it was pretty
difficult to identify them under her binocular dissection microscope. I
suggested maybe she should try out a consumer digital microscope before
trying to get her grant coordinator to spring for anything huge and
expensive. She picked up a [Celestron
microscope](http://www.celestron.com/c3/product.php?CatID=81&ProdID=516)
on sale from Amazon.

Obviously, it's not going to perform like one of the Nikon or Leica lab
scopes, but it cost about one thirtieth as much, and it's humorously
easy to use. If she can use it to zero in on the features used to
identify these things and easily document what she sees, it'll do.

Here's what I was able to capture with a Chalcid wasp in ethanol with no
slip cover. No effort was made to orient the objective, stain it, or
improve the contrast. I just focused and hit the capture button.

Hmm... Looks like it might actually be usable with a little practice.
The depth of field is not great, though.

I've been curious about the feasibility of making usable lab equipment
as mass-produced consumer products. This scope is probably good enough
for some specific problems, but not as a piece of generally usable lab
equipment. But it's not as far away as I expected, actually.
