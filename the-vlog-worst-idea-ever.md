Summary: 


I will admit, YouTube is cool. You can upload video you made yourself.
Fantastic. Great. Wonderful. But "vlogging"? That's just stupid.

Blogs are great because anyone who has...

-   an idea
-   a computer
-   internet access
-   modest command of a written language

...can start sharing their ideas with the rest of the world (at least,
the rest of the world that has a computer). That's actually rather
revolutionary. It's Many-to-Many communication on a scale never seen
before.

But do you really want to *see*, you know, the masses? If we start with
the quality of the average written blog entry, and we use that as a
benchmark to predict the average quality of a vlog entry (were the
practice to contaminate the general population), you get something
rather like your uncle Ed's wedding video, except it's just a video of
him trying to tell you something.

Please, for god's sake, [spare us from
