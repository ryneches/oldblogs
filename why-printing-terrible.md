Summary: 


Mimi and I spent a good chunk of yesterday trying to print a three page
PDF document. First, her dad's year-old HP OfficeJet 6300 stripped a
gear in its paper feeder with no paper in the loading tray. It now seems
to be beyond repair. So, we went over to her cousin's house, and a her
HP all-in-one choked on a strangely formatted paper size directive. The
error codes suggest that the printer's firmware got corrupted, but we
couldn't get any more detail on account of Vista's printer stack
simultaneously shitting itself, and remaining resolutely shat even after
the usual Windows hokey-pokey of uninstalling/reinstalling, rebooting
and banging the table and swearing.

We emailed the damn thing to her sister at her office, and she spent an
hour futzing around with it before getting it to live uncomfortably on
an 8.5"x11" sheet of paper, only to discover that someone had swiped the
fuser wire from the big office laser printer. Six hours after we
started, the three pages finally emerged from an old printer Lan found
somewhere in a closet.

This seems to be the normal experience when you want to print an
important document. Why is it still so awful? Why do people not riot in
the streets and burn HP executives alive on pyres of new-but-broken
plastic-crap printers? Why do people continue to allow PostScript to
live?
