Summary: 


I finished bolting together the last bits of my tokamak equilibrium
solver the day before yesterday, and wrapped up the basic debugging
yesterday. Now it's time to run some tests.

I could probably finish most of the testing on the airplane from London
to Newark, but alas, my laptop (and everything else) will be in the
cargo compartment. Bugger.
