Summary: 


For the first time, I just paid more than \$4 a gallon for gasoline. It
cost \$40.34 to fill the tank on my tiny Toyota Yaris. My commute to
UCLA is 37 miles each way, and I get about 38 MPG for that trip. I
normally do a little better, but the Sepulveda Pass always seems to
wreck my milage. At about \$0.11 a mile, one trip costs me \$7.77. If I
drove in every day, it would cost me about \$155 a month. That's almost
as much as the payments on the car. If gas goes up another 84 cents,
then I'd be paying more for the gasoline than the car *just from driving
to school*.

Ouch.

Meanwhile, a Metro day pass costs \$5, and [a month pass is
\$62.00](http://prostores2.carrierzone.com/servlet/mtanet/Categories?category=Metro+Pass).
If you commute in LA, chances are pretty good that your employer will
buy your pass for you.
