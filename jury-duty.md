Summary: 


Finally, the judge released from jury duty, so I can talk about what
I've been doing for the last week-and-change.

The case was pretty simple, but wasn't completely cut-and-dry. Here is
the basic sequence of events :

1.  There was a birthday party with about 12 people. The defendant was
    one of the guests.
2.  The party ended, and the guests went to the sidewalk to get their
    cars.
3.  The valet brought her 2007 Mercedes S-class to the curb, but did a
    crappy job of parking it.
4.  Another car (an brand new Austin Martin) stopped to wait for the
    defendant's car to pull out.
5.  Traffic backed up for about a block (a long block).
6.  Two motorcycle officers saw the traffic, and noticed that the
    blockage started at the valet area. This had happened before. They
    made a U-turn to see if they could get things moving again.
7.  ???
8.  The defendant, now in her car, pulled away from the curb. The Austin
    Martin took its spot, and traffic started moving again. The officers
    decide that nothing more needed to be done.
9.  The defendant's car stopped after traveling about the length of two
    parked cars. The defendant later explained that this was to put on
    her seatbelt.
10. Seeing that traffic was once again blocked, the officer activated
    his lights and his squawker.
11. The defendant moved her car up the street about the length of three
    parked cars, and turned onto Hollywood Blvd, where she yielded to
    the curb.
12. The officer had only intended to prod her into moving along, but
    since she had pulled over, he figured he should investigate a little
    more.
13. The officer smelled alcohol as soon as the window was rolled down.
14. The officer ordered her out of the car and performed a field
    sobriety test, on which the defendant performed poorly (but not the
    worst he'd ever seen). The officer then offered her a voluntary
    breathalyser test, which measured her at more than twice the legal
    limit. She was arrested, booked, and tested again at the police
    station with a more sophisticated machine, where she once again came
    in at more than twice the legal limit.

She was charged with driving under the influence and with driving with a
0.08 BAC or above.

The sticky part was what happened at between items 6 and 8. The
arresting officer testified that the defendant was in the car the whole
time. Basically, that nothing happened between item 6 and 8. The defense
alleged that the defendant was waiting for her designated driver, and
that the officer ordered her into the car, and ordered her to move it.
Unfortunately, the evidence that might have supported this allegation
(witness testimony) was apparently deemed inadmissible.

I suppose that the judge decided that whether or not she was ordered to
drive was irrelevant, on the grounds that she could have refused the
order. However, one of the key elements needed to sustain this kind of
charge is that the act needs to be voluntary and deliberate (although
one need not necessarily intend to break the law). If the officer's
order somehow stripped her of her volition, that may undermine the
charge.

However, we were never permitted to hear evidence to support the
allegation that she was ordered into the car. Evidently, the judge
didn't buy the argument that such an order might have stripped the
defendant of her volition. So, based on the evidence we had on hand, we
were forced to hand down a verdict of guilty on both charges.

Personally, I would have preferred to hear the argument and evidence
pertaining to her volition. I probably would have urged a guilty verdict
anyway, but I think it might have been relevant. After all, if a police
officer orders you to do something, most people feel an extraordinary
pressure to comply. If, in this case, the officer orders you to do
something that happens to be illegal, I suppose it must be ones own
responsibility to refuse. If that is what happened, the argument should
have been vetted before the jury. It might not have helped the
defendant, but if that is why she did what she did, she should have been
permitted to explain herself.

Anyway, I'm very curious to find out what arguments were made during the
sidebar discussions. Maybe I'll feel better about the verdict when I
find out what was kept secret from us.

Otherwise, the experience was very interesting. We had a very
entertaining bailiff. If you ever get pulled over by a Los Angeles
County Sheriff named Rodriguez, and who has big tattoos on her biceps
and talks very fast, she's only *acting* like a jerk. She's actually a
very nice person. The jury had a lot of [interesting
people](http://rachel.aviles.us/).

Oh, and [George Takei](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001786/) was in my
jury pool. He was dismissed, but I got a chance grumble a little about
transportation to the courthouse with him and to say hello as he was
leaving the next day. I wasn't quite sure if it was him, but his voice
is absolutely unmistakable. He's also a really nice guy in person,
though I don't think that's really news to anyone -- [except maybe Tim
Hardaway](http://www.influks.com/post897.html).
