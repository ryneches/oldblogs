Summary: 


Here is a curious thought regarding "controversy" over whether or not
Congress should force Mr. Bush to withdraw the troops from Iraq. For
months, the Republican mantra has been that Congress (and the general
public) shouldn't try to second-guess the commanders in the field. It
sounds reasonable, except for one thing. The military reports to a
civilian government. The civilian government, of which Congress is a
coequal part, is supposed to tell the commanders what to do.

Obviously, if the civilian authorities give the Military bad
instructions, that is a bad thing. So, it stands to reason that when
Congress (or the president) gives instructions to the Military, the
instructions should be of a nature that recognizes, respects and
utilizes the planning and logistics capabilities of the Military. The
timetable in the supplemental spending bill did just that; it gave no
instructions regarding the operational details of the pullout, and
instead would have instructed the Military to put into play its own
policies and procedures regarding how to conduct the pullout. The
language was crafted explicitly to *avoid* micromanaging the commanders
in the field.

I know it's a rather tired refrain, but the accusations regarding
"micromanagement" of the Military is rather hypocritical of this
administration. Remember how the [US Army War College said the invasion
was a bad
idea](http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2003/record_bounding.pdf)?
Yeah...
