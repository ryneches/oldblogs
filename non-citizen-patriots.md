Summary: 


I knew that a lot of soldiers in the US military are immigrants, but I
here are a few facts that I [discovered
today](http://alisavaldesrodriguez.blogspot.com/2006/04/more-stupidity-in-my-in-box.html)
that are rather interesting:

-   All men of military age are required to register for Selective
    Service, including illegal immigrants.
-   One in ten soldiers who have died in Iraq were immigrants.
-   About five percent (!!!!) of soldiers in the US armed forces are
    illegal immigrants.
-   The first solder to die in Iraq was Marine Lance Cpl. Jose
    Gutierrez, who was an illegal immigrant from Guatemala.

People enlist for a lot of reasons. Whatever those reasons, if you're
willing to risk your life by serving in the military, I think it's safe
to say that you're pretty much comitted to the idea of America. Whatever
their politics, no one is going to let people shoot at them for the sake
of something unless they believe in it very, very strongly. Some
conclusions we can draw:

-   Many immigrant soldiers who died in Iraq enlisted as soon as they
    arrived. These people fought and died for a new home they were never
    allowed to enjoy, and they died for freedoms and principles from
    which they never personally benefitted.
-   Illegal immigrants make up less than three percent of the US
    population, and yet comprise five percent of US armed forces. That
    means they are about twice as likely to enlist as a citizen.

Could it be that illegal immigrants are more serious about their
patriotism that citizens? If the attendees of the march on Washington
today are any indication...

...maybe that's not such a crazy question after all.
