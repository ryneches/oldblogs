Summary: 


I was going out to the garden to wash off the cat-litter-scooper this
evening, and I noticed a tiny bat clinging to my screen door. It was
hanging out about knee level, and I was worried my cats would take an
interest in it. So, I tried to shoo it away, but it just chirped at me
and clung onto the screen harder.

I thought maybe it was hurt (or worse, sick), so I captured it in a
plastic bowl to observe. It didn't do anything to evade capture, and
allowed itself to be sort of gently scooped up by the edge of the bowl.
It walked around a little and chirped, but didn't do try to escape.

Since it didn't seem to be interested in flying around the apartment, I
transferred it to the lid of the bowl, where it allowed itself to be
photographed. I put a bead of water near its nose, which it prodded a
little but didn't seem to drink.

I brought it outside again to see if I could get it to fly away. I held
the lid out over a soft patch of ground and lowered it quickly, it
spread its wings but didn't fly. I tried a few more times, and got it to
fly as far as the fence. Finally, some tapping on the fence convinced it
to flap away.

Does anyone know if this is normal behavior for this kind of bat?
