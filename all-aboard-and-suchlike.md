Summary: 


Since I've been telling anyone who'll listen for the last couple of
years that we've got to use trains for travel more often, I decided that
I should take my own advice. I'm going to visit my little sister in
Oklahoma, so I'm taking Amtrak there from Los Angeles. I'm taking the
[Texas Eagle](http://www.texaseagle.com/) to Fort Worth, and then the
[Heartland Flyer](http://www.heartlandflyer.com/) to Norman, Oklahoma.

It's going to be a long trip (about two days). It could be a lot
shorter, but we've been letting our passenger rail service rot for sixty
years. I'll post pictures from the trip when I get to Norman, and sooner
if I can snipe some WiFi along the way. Until I do, here is a picture of
the Capital Corridor train rolling into Davis.
