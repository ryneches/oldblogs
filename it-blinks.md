Summary: 


While waiting for a calculation for the (now infamous) paper to finish,
I finally got around to loading a program onto my [Arduino
board](http://www.arduino.cc/). I can now blink and LED on and off!

This is the wrong LED to use -- it seems to want more juice than the
board can supply -- but it's all I had on hand at the moment. Anyway,
I'd like to pimp [Spark Fun Electronics](http://www.sparkfun.com). I
grumbled at them for what I thought was a quality control issue, but it
turned out to just be a strange solder joint required in the new board
revision.

I plan to use this little guy to control the knobs and two-line serial
vacuum florescent display for the radio head unit for my car. Yes, I
know aftermarket head units exist; I just can't find one that runs on 6
Volts.
