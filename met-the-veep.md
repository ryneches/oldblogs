Summary: 


I got to meet Al Gore at Borders today, and picked up a copy of the book
for *An Inconvenient Truth*. I know it's been said many times before,
but I really am astonished at how different he is in person than he was
during the 2000 presidential race. He was funny, casual, and completely
at ease, even as the requisite Westwood Insane Homeless Person screamed
nonsense at him from the first floor. He signed a huge number of books
in a very short period of time, and managed to do it without seeming to
hurry anyone. He didn't rush around and scowl like I've seen authors at
book signings do. He went through the two hour ordeal giving off the
impression of being busy, but happy to listen to people if they had
something to say. Several people in the line went on at length about
what they were going to ask him "when their turn came," but when they
got to the table, almost no one pestered him.

The other thing I didn't realize, even from his performance in his
movie, is how bear-like he is. He's about my height, but if I were drawn
in pencil, he'd have to be drawn with a Sharpie.

Anyway, I also picked up a bunch of Terry Pratchett books. Mimi's family
and Pierre gave me a Borders gift cards for my birthday, and good use is
being made of them.

While I'm happy to have a signed copy of his book, I'd much rather see
his name on a ballot.
