Summary: 


So, if you wear a T-shirt with Arabic writing on it, that's probable
cause to be [questioned, searched, and potentially barred from
flying](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5297822.stm?ls)? That makes
me want to puke. Evidently, the entire Arabic language is now offensive.

I don't speak a word of Arabic, but if someone will tell me how to
write, "If this T-Shirt is all it takes to make you worry, then you are
a racist asshole," I will put it on a T-Shirt and wear it whenever I
fly.
