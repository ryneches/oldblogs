Summary: 


A few days ago, the new Django 1.0 packages got installed on our colo
machine. Evidently, the Django people decided to [break a whole ton of
stuff](http://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/BackwardsIncompatibleChanges).
It took me a couple of days of desperate hacking to get the site up and
running again before classes started.
