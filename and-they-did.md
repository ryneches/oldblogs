Summary: 


Four years ago today, George Bush said this :

> "There are some who feel like, that conditions are such that they can
> attack us there. My answer is: Bring them on. We got the force
> necessary to deal with the situation." \
>  -- George W. Bush on Iraq, 2 July 2003

Nowadays, "they," being the insurgency, attacks us "there," being nearly
every corner of Iraq, on a daily basis. Nearly every day, in ones and
twos and sometimes more, our guys are getting picked off.

The deaths happen with such regularity that the news has ceased to say
very much about these singular, individual and profound losses, but
write instead to the general condition of having our soldiers die in
Iraq. The news from Iraq is reported in the much the same manner as the
general condition of the weather. The reporting on casualties has the
same tone you might expect to hear, "It has been hot this Summer."

Today, George Bush celebrated the anniversary of "Bring them on" by
commuting Scooter Libby's prison prison sentence. Scooter Libby, who
perjured himself before a federal grand jury in an effort to cover up
the deliberate and criminal disclosure of the covert status of a an
operating CIA officer causing the endangerment and/or loss of valuable
intelligence assets, was effectively pardoned today.

George Bush must be aiming for an approval rating in the 15% range.
