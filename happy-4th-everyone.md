Summary: 


Long before the September 11th attacks, Bill Clinton decided that Osama
bin Laden was a threat. Last year, George the Second decided he wasn't
worth tracking down, and [disbanded the CIA effort to apprehend
him](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/04/washington/04intel.html?_r=1&oref=login).
How profoundly depressing.
