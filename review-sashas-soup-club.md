Summary: 


One of the cool things about living in Davis is the amazing number of
unique creative enterprises and projects people open up to the public. I
suppose Davis is a comfortable place for people to try things out.

If you live in Davis, you should try [Sasha's Soup
Club](http://sashassoupclub.com/). After a few weeks of envying the
tasty lunches my labmates were enjoying, I joined the mailing list. I
just received my allotment Leek and Potato soup, delivered by Sasha
herself.

What can I say? It's damn good soup, exactly as described. The flavor of
the potatoes and leeks both stand out nicely. Whatever else is in it,
the other flavors are there to make a nice background.

I get nervous about making things with so few flavors. When I aim to
make a simple soup, it will usually end up with six or seven different
ingredients with strong flavors. If one of them comes out a little weak,
you can still enjoy the others.

My general approach to hobbies is massive over-engineering. This is why
the computer desk I built for my mother is rated for 7200 pounds (I
tested it by stacking dead tractor engine blocks on top of it). I know
that I'll never make a living as a chef or as a furniture builder. But
if I build something, goddamnit, it's not going to fall down. So, when I
make soup, or a sandwich, or a salad, I keep adding ingredients that I'm
*sure* will taste good until something in my head says, "Yup, it'll
hold."

It's greatly reassuring to me that there are people who know how to make
awesome things with simple economy. I know I can make potato leek soup
myself; I made some just last week. It was good, but then again,
anything would be good if you loaded it up with enough garlic, onions,
cheese, olive oil, peppercorns and sea salt. I wouldn't have had the
confidence to make *this* soup.

Now, the only problem is not eating it all before I have a chance to
gloat over it at lunch.
