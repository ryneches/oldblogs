This is the first in a series of articles I plan to write over the next
three weeks covering my field expedition to Uzon Caldera and attendance
the 2010 International Workshop on Biodiversity, Molecular Biology and
Biogeochemistry of Thermophiles. In this post, I'll outline my plans for
the series and explain why I'm writing it.

If you would like to follow along, check in [here](http://vort.org/), or
subscribe to my [RSS feed](http://vort.org/feeds/posts/). Or if you
would like to follow the series and not the rest of my blog, I will be
tagging all of the posts in the series
[kamchatka](http://vort.org/tag/kamchatka/). At Uzon Caldera, I will be
posting updates to [my Twitter feed](http://twitter.com/ryneches) by
satellite phone (you can also subscribe to [my Twitter RSS
feed](http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/139199975.rss).)

Before I leave on Tuesday, I will post articles introducing the natural
history of Kamchatka, my plans and preparations for getting getting
there and working there, and maybe a few other things.

I have two broad goals :

-   Study the biochemistry, genomics, and physiology of thermophilic
    organisms in their natural habitat.
-   Document and share the experience.

These are two fairly distinct missions. First of all, I'm looking for
material for my thesis, particularly a
[metagenomic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagenomics) target suitable
for the technique I'm developing. For the hard science, I will try to
confine myself to observations and avoid drawing conclusions. I'll save
that for the journals.

The second mission is to bring you along. I've been asked by [my thesis
advisor](http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/) to write about,
[photograph](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rneches/tags/kamchatka/),
[tweet](http://twitter.com/ryneches) and
[film](http://www.youtube.com/user/ryneches) as much of the field
expedition and the workshop as possible, and present it as an example of
what it's like to actually *do* science. My goal is to present the
company, the food, the work, the travel, the joys, the annoyances, the
surprises, the good, the bad, and the ridiculous.

Science remains firmly misunderstood by the public. My personal
experience suggests that the public actually understands the products of
science -- powerful theories and key facts -- a bit better than polling
data suggests. The core of public misunderstanding, I think, rests in
how people believe science works as an institution and as a profession.

A couple of years ago, [Fermilab](http://www.fnal.gov) invited a group
of seventh graders to visit the laboratory to check out the [various
awesome things](http://ed.fnal.gov/) they have available for the public
to see. Before the visit, the students were asked to write about what
they thought scientists were like, and to draw a picture to go along
with it. After the visit, they were asked to repeat the exercise. The
results
[eye-opening](http://ed.fnal.gov/projects/scientists/index.html). Here
is an example I particularly liked, from a girl named Rachel :

### before

### after

Most of the before pictures feature lab coats filled by older, white men
without much hair. Many of the kids mentioned that they thought
scientists were "a little bit crazy," and most represented their
scientist as some sort of authority figure. The after-visit results are
equally interesting; many of the comments seem astonished that
scientists have families, and that they enjoy things other than science.

The phrase "regular people" comes up again and again in their
after-visit writing. Students are usually pretty good at ignoring
phrases that are deliberately emphasized. When you see a bunch students
incorporate exactly the same phrase into a free-form writing assignment,
it's usually something that an adult mentioned without anticipating the
impact it would have. The concept that scientists could be "regular
people" was evidently a bit of a shock.

Obviously this is anecdotal, and it's important not to read too much
into it. It is, however, a useful example of the sort of challenges we
face if we want society to understand science itself, rather than simply
memorizing the things science produces. None of this is original to me.
If you want an entertaining treatment of science in the media, check out
Christopher Frayling's *[Mad, Bad and Dangerous?: The Scientist and the
Cinema](http://www.amazon.com/Mad-Bad-Dangerous-Scientist-Cinema/dp/1861892551)*
(I apologize for the bizarre question-mark colon thing).

I've written about this before. Last November, [I
wrote](http://vort.org/2009/11/26/speaking-science/) :

Scientists have a responsibility to share what they do.

Over the next three weeks, I'm going to put that thought into action.
