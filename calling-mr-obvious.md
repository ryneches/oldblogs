Summary: 


Evidently, cyber-jihadists are [planning to launch an
attack](http://apnews.excite.com/article/20061201/D8LNPBGO0.html) on the
web sites of US stock market and banking web sites, or so the U.S.
Computer Emergency Readiness Team has learned from a blog somewhere.

I'm sure the security operations people at those institutions are glad
for the heads up, although they are probably a little busy dealing with
the millions of other attacks that hit those web sites every day. The
NYSE's web site, and the web site of all major stock exchanges, are not
strictly necessary for critical operations. In the unlikely event that
the attacks succeed (where millions of other similar attacks fail),
there would be no impact on the exchange itself. In any event, it
doesn't seem as if website defacement is a major concern. Christopher
Westfall, Managing Editor of KPMG's *Banking Insider* wrote in the
Winter 2005 report "The State of the Banking Industry" :

Website defacement is one of the *least* important threats to a
financial company, with the possible exception of online banks (though
even online banks usually separate their public websites from their
banking web applications). If I were a security operations officer at a
major company, I would be tempted to treat the main part of the public
website as a sort of punching bag for people who are angry at the
company. I might deliberately allow defacement of the website every now
and then, on the grounds that this will probably satisfy most determined
attackers. Having scribbled their message across the main home page,
they would likely be less inclined to attack assets that are actually
important.

So, as long as the DHS is recycling marginally credible threats of
annoying mischief that it finds on obscure blogs, I might as well reveal
that I am planning to explode some expensive TV broadcast satellites
using focused beams of my own brain waves.
