Summary: 


After a two hour delay, my flight to Newark finally got off the ground
from Gatwick. Thanks to the general terror freak-out, we weren't allowed
to bring anything on the plane except our passports and boarding cards.
At the security checkpoint, they told us that we would even have to
discard the paper sleeves our tickets came in. No books or magazines,
not even ones we purchased *after* going through security. But then,
there was a *second* security checkpoint on the way to the gate, and
they even confiscated the postage stamps I was carrying.

Turns out that was all bunk; we were supposed to be allowed to bring
aboard non-liquid items purchased after the first security checkpoint.
In fact, the second security checkpoint wasn't even really supposed to
be operating as a checkpoint; they were just supposed to look for
"suspicious" people and give them an extra search. But somehow, no one
got the memo (or whatever), and they just started confiscating
everything.

And then, to add insult to injury, as soon as I arrive in the US, the
freak-out [starts to wind
down](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4789169.stm). Goddamnit. I
don't ever want to fly again.
