Summary: 


Today's lecture was mostly review. We started off by going over
perturbation theory again in much more detail (and without the long
diversion about degeneracy). Then we worked an example, again using the
Stark effect. We calculated the upper and lower bounds of the error from
truncating infinite series in the second-order estimate. Fun was had by
all.

Then, we looked at the Zeeman effect (neglecting spin effects) using
perturbation theory. I think perturbation theory is becoming less
perturbing to me.

In other news, someone crashed into Abers' car while it was parked.
Evidently, the person who hit his car also hit a couple of other parked
cars, and then abandoned their vehicle. I saw something like this happen
once a few years ago. The police thought the guy was drunk, but he came
up negative on the breath test, and he looked more surprised than
inebriated. It turned out that the driver had undiagnosed diabetes, and
had passed out at the wheel.
