Summary: 


So, the Markey amendment to the COPE Act failed in the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, with 34 voting against and 23 voting for it. So, now
the COPE act heads to the House floor. There's still a chance to amend
it. Please [call your congresswoman (or
congressman)](http://clerk.house.gov/members/mcapdir.html) and encourage
them to support the amendment of the COPE act to preserve the common
carrier model (or "network neutrality" as it has been styled in this
debate). If you don't know who your congress-critter is, but you know
where you live, [you can look up your district by
map](http://nationalatlas.gov/printable/congress.html).

Explain to them that AT&T staked its fortune on the idea that it makes
sense to charge more for certain kinds of information, and that it makes
sense to charge per-minute. The fruits of this idea are obvious. Despite
the fact that AT&T started out with the *only* nation-wide network of
sufficient size and sophistication to act as a (stupendously profitable)
modern data carrier, their commitment to the pre-World War I era concept
of non-uniform pricing and per-minute billing instead drove them into
decline and irrelevance. AT&T was once a powerhouse of American
innovation, but its leaders failed to understand the basic economics of
their own business. By basic, I mean that applying a small lesson from a
*high school economics class* would have permitted them to save AT&T.
They could have just picked up a text on economics, and looked up
"network economy" in the index. But they didn't, and as a result, one of
America's greatest enterprises crashed and burned, taking tens of
thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of capital along with it.

So, now AT&T wants to repeat the great success they've had in the last
20 years, but this time with the *entire American information economy*.

No thank you.
