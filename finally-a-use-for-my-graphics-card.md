Summary: 


When I bought my graphics card, I was motivated by the mistaken belief
that I would have time to play video games. "Fantasy" doesn't even begin
to describe it; "delusion" would probably be more accurate. Since then,
I have been thoroughly disabused of my delusions of free time.

So, I have an aging but very nice Radeon 9200 card in my workstation
machine. Something like 95% of the circuitry on a modern graphics card
is dedicated to 3D graphics, where on my computer, it has been doing
*absolutely nothing*. That is, until [Pete](http://vodun.org) introduced
me to the [Beryl Project](http://www.beryl-project.org). Wobbly windows!
Rotating desktop cubes! Real-time alpha blending! Crazy window
transformations!

I guess I'll never have time to play games. I don't feel so sad about
that anymore; I can have almost as much fun watching my terminal windows
undulate across my desktop like drunken sea creatures.
