Summary: 


![](http://vort.org/media/images/burned_tree.jpg)

I normally don't talk a lot about my personal life on my blog, and
except for the occasional announcement, I'd like to keep it that way.
People's little triumphs and tragedies are mainly interesting to those
directly involved, and are at best kind of boring to everyone else. A
lot of my friends and family do read this blog, but by and large most of
you are strangers or acquaintances. I try to respect that.

Those of you who are close to me know that I'm going through a sad time
in my life right now. Those of you who work or study with me have
probably noticed that I've not been my usual cheerful self. In deference
to the many people who aren't here to read about that, and the fact that
I can barely think about it (never mind write about it), I'm not going
to discuss what's happened on my blog.

The one thing that has helped has been hearing about all the cool things
that other people are doing. So, even though I'm not exactly Mr. Social
right now, please don't take that as a sign that I want to be left
alone.

On the contrary. Now would be a great time to tell me about whatever is
on your mind, especially if it's cool.

To those of you who've been kind enough to treat me like a normal person
over the last two weeks despite my melancholy behavior, I owe you guys.
Really.
