Summary: 


My camera lens got smashed when we were traveling to Berlin, so I bought
a new one yesterday. My old lens was the Nikkor 18-55mm AF-S that came
with my camera, which is now pretty much wrecked. The new lens is the
Nikkor 50mm f/1.8D AF. Not as fancy, but it's nicer for indoor shots.
Plus, it's about half the size, so it's better for traveling.
