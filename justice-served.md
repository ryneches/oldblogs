Summary: 


After nearly a year arguing with the City of Los Angeles Parking
Authority (or whatever they call themselves), I'm finally vindicated!

Yes, folks, you *can* drive your car without a front plate in the state
of California, provided:

-   Your plates were issued before 1987
-   You don't mind arguing with bureaucrats a lot

Hooray!

Gunther is now re-registered and insured. Once again, I am mobile!
