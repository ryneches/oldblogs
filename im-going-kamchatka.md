Summary: 


I just got the reservations for my flight to
[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky)
for the International Workshop on Biodiversity, Molecular Biology and
Biogeochemistry of Thermophiles, hosted by Moscow State University and
Winogradsky Institute of Microbiology.

I've been working on the analysis of environmental samples from two
sites at [Uzon
Caldera](http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=1000-17=)
(about 10,000 Sanger reads from each sequenced at the
[JGI](http://www.jgi.doe.gov/)), and I'm hoping that I'll be able to
reprocess the DNA here at the UC Davis Genome Center using some of [our
high-throughput
machines](http://www.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/dna_technologies/uhtsequencing.html).
Licensing and customs restrictions will probably make it impossible to
bring my own samples back, but I may be able to entrust them to a
colleague with fancier credentials than my own.

Insofar as it will be possible, I will be blogging from Kamchatka and
uploading photographs and data, so please ask questions in the comments!

I'll be arriving in Petropavlovsk on the 30th of July, with the help of
a generous grant from the Carnegie Institution for Science [Deep Carbon
Observatory](http://dco.ciw.edu/).
