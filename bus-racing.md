Summary: 


On my way home from UCLA today, I decided to see how fast I ride my bike
from Westwood and to the terminus of the Metro Purple Line on Wilshire
and Western. Particularly, I was interested to see if I could get there
quicker than the 720 bus. To make it fair, I waited until there was
almost no traffic for the bus to get mired in. Rush hour now lasts well
into the late evening, so traffic was heavy but not jammed at 9:00 PM.

I waited for a 720 bus to pull into the station, and then took off. It
was pretty much a dead heat until the Starbucks at San Vincente, and I
got a couple of lucky breaks from the walk signals. I beat the bus to
Western by about four minutes, completing the trip in 43 minutes without
breaking a sweat. Oh, and it's mostly an uphill ride with lots of
pedestrians to which one must yield.
