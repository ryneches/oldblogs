Summary: 


Last week, I got an urgent call from the [National Marrow Donor
Program](http://vort.org/2009/06/09/what-are-you-waiting/). Somewhere,
there is a girl about to go into chemotherapy, and my [tissue
type](http://vort.org/2009/06/19/marrow-donor-kit/) matches hers. They
needed to run some more detailed tissue typing, and screen for
infections diseases. The NMDP sent a kit to the UC Davis student health
center (the [new
building](http://healthcenter.ucdavis.edu/about/new-building.html) is
right next to my house), and I had my blood drawn this morning.

I *hate* giving blood. They didn't need very much, but I don't get along
very well with steel needles. I count it as a major victory that I
didn't barf until I got home.

Now we all wait for the results.

Good luck, whoever you are.
