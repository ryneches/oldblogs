Summary: 


I just got my first pieces back from glaze firing today! They turned out
much better than I expected, though, honestly, I wasn't expecting much.

This is a smallish cereal bowl (about eight inches in diameter). It is,
thus far, the most symmetrical piece I've made, and I'm really happy
with it.

This was the first piece I threw. I haven't thrown clay since I was
about eight years old, so this is the first in about twenty years! I was
pleasantly surprised to find that it's actually reasonably usable and
not altogether hideous.
