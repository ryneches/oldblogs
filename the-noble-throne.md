Summary: 


Something to think about next time you're sitting on the can: 2.5
billion people do not have access to a toilet.

Next time you get into a seat up/down argument with a co-inhabitant, why
not settle the argument by recognizing how lucky you are to have a
toilet in the first place? Donate a few bucks to the [World Toilet
Organization](http://www.worldtoilet.org).
