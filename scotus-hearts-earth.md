Summary: 


In a 5-to-4 decision, the Supreme Court has found that the EPA can (and
possibly *must*) [regulate the emissions of greenhouse
gases](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/02/washington/02cnd-scotus.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin).
The case was brought by Massachusetts, California, Connecticut,
Illinois, Maine, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island,
Vermont, Washington, Baltimore, the District of Columbia, New York City,
and a cadre of environmental groups.

This will pave the way for a whole host of innovative policy options.
For example, scaling vehicle registration fees with fuel efficiency,
mandatory fuel economy standards, various kinds of carbon taxes (and
credits), and all sorts of good stuff. The decision removes one of the
biggest obstacles to policy implementation.

The media is probably going to focus on the potential nation-wide
impacts, but I don't think Congress or the White House will come up with
anything interesting. Even if 2008 is a banner year for Democrats, the
federal government probably isn't going to enact any interesting or
effective environmental policy. Realistically, a positive role in in
environmental policy for the federal government will be in funding
capital projects and research, and as an experienced manager of data.

The states are a different story. The decision will (I think) allow
state-EPAs to move forward with regional policies. For example,
California can finally enact the fuel economy standards for which it has
fought for so long, or Massachusetts can get more aggressive about wind
power. Some of the states will do nothing, and some will try things that
turn out to be dumb. However, some of them will have the will and the
know-how to come enact policy with real promise. The ideas that work
will be copied, eventually percolating upward to federal policy after a
generation or so.

Hooray for Federalism!
