This is a point that the Talking Head Corps seems to be unable to grasp.
Supporting a war isn't courageous. Actually fighting in a war probably
is courageous, but getting on television and gushing about the necessity
of a war is not brave.

To quote Issac Asimov, "Violence is the last resort of the incompetent."
