Summary: 


The term "alternative energy" annoys me. It is a sloppy bit of
wordsmithing. Do we really have an *alternative* to this?

No, actually. We don't. It's obvious, by simple inspection, that the
scene above cannot continue. Even if we wanted to continue making
electricity this way, it is impossible. Any activity this intensive and
inefficient will run its course very quickly. It could happen in several
ways, but the simplest and surest way it will stop is that they will
simply run out of coal.

On one hand, we have a few reasonably non-destructive means of
generating energy, like wind and solar. On the other hand, we have
idiocy and crime. How is it *alternative energy* when there is
essentially no choice?

[As I've pointed
out](http://vort.org/2007/12/18/the-carbon-cutting-game/), coal is
responsible for most of our carbon emissions, but provides less than a
third of our generating capaicty. That is stupid. I suggest we dump the
terms "green energy" and "alternative energy," and simply call those
things *energy*, and use the term "dumb energy" to refer to coal.
