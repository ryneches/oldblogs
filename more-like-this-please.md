Summary: 


Over the years, I've grown to loathe air travel. The major carriers are
suffering from a deep institutional decay, and airports have turned into
a nightmare landscape of law enforcement gone mad. Airports are little
pockets of brutal, bureaucratic totalitarianism in an otherwise mostly
free country. If you want to know what fascism would look like in modern
America, just visit an airport, and imagine a whole city run that way.
Fascism in Germany was characterized by the German mania for efficient
organization. America doesn't do efficient organization. Fascism in
America would be huge, blundering and incompetent. The catchphrase of
German fascism was, "Papers, please." In America, it would be, "We can't
find your papers." It would be like an airport.

It would be bad enough if it weren't for the surly attitude and lousy
service from the major airlines. The IRS is better at customer service
than the major carriers. They really are. The first time I had to file a
tax return, I didn't even know where to start. I called the IRS. They
were polite, answered all my questions, and explained how to fix things
if I made a mistake. They told me how to file for an extension, if I
needed to. They gave me a list of local certified tax accountants if I
wanted more technical advice. They were even cheerful about it. Good
luck finding that kind of treatment from an airline official on a busy
day.

That said, I've always liked JetBlue. They are one of the few bright
spots in an otherwise rotten industry. If there was some way that I
could board their flights without having to run the gauntlet of idiotic
airport hassle/security, I might actually enjoy flying.

Last weekend was a very bad weekend for JetBlue. Leaving thousands of
passengers stranded and angry, it seemed that their effort to be the
Good Airline might have finally broken. Fortunately, that seems not to
be the case.

Sincere apologies are rare in our culture. The best you'll hear in most
cases is something like, "We are sorry that this unfortunate thing has
happened." So, when the CEO of a major airline sends an email to his
company's customers that says, "Words cannot express how truly sorry we
are for the anxiety, frustration and inconvenience **that we caused**."
He doesn't even blame the storm, or the facilities, or bad luck. This is
called "taking responsibility." It's something that grown-ups are
supposed to do, but that CEOs and presidents and small children usually
do not.

[The Passenger's Bill of
Rights](http://www.jetblue.com/p/about/ourcompany/promise/Bill_Of_Rights.pdf)
is a good idea. It's what airlines should have been doing all along.

Taking responsibility when things go wrong is probably the most
important function of a leader. It's something that our current national
leadership is notoriously bad at. It should come as little surprise,
then, that JetBlue is the only US carrier that is a [significant
contributor to the Democratic
party](http://www.buyblue.org/node/1244/view/summary).
