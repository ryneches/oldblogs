Summary: 


Evidently, when a chunk of software is simultaneously licensed under the
BSD license and the GPL, it becomes unusable to projects that use the
BSD license. No, wait. GPLed projects can borrow BSD licensed code, but
not visa versa. No wait. When a chunk of code is under a dual BSD/GPL
license, you get to pick which one to follow, which means you can ignore
one of them.

I just want to write code and let other people use it. If people make
improvements, I'd be happier if they gave their improvements back to me.
Why is this so goddamn *difficult*?
