Summary: 


Today we discussed transitions using time independent perturbation
theory. Some strange things happened with relativity that I didn't
catch. OK -- I didn't catch it because I was working on a homework
assignment during lecture.

The end result was the formula for the decay transition of an individual
system, which coincidentally is the same as the formula for fractional
decay in a bulk material from statistical mechanics. The two decay rules
are distinct, as they are based on different physics and describe
different systems.
