Summary: 


The news says that Saddam will be hanged pretty much any minute now. I'm
opposed to the death penalty on principle, but I think that there are
extraordinary cases where it may be justified. Genocidal leaders are one
of the few categories of humans who I think should face the death
penalty.

However, I think it is a huge mistake to execute Saddam, especially now.
Once deposed, genocidal leaders can serve humanity in the critically
important function of providing a focal point for the investigation and
historical elucidation of genocide and conflict. Saddam is much more
valuable to Iraqis alive than dead.

Furthermore, the country is still occupied by a foreign army (ours), the
courts are neither trustworthy nor independent, and a sectarian civil
war is still raging. Clearly he is guilty of the crimes for which he has
been sentenced, and if any crime is bad enough to merit execution, his
certainly do. Nevertheless, I hope his execution is postponed. He has a
lot to answer for, and he should be made to answer for it in a working
court system.
