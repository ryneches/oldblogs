Summary: 


My article on bike safety is in print in the [Davis
Enterprise](http://www.davisenterprise.com/)! I was invited to write
this column as a follow up to my [Davis Crash Map
article](http://vort.org/2009/04/29/davis-crash-map/) and [Anna's
accident in 2007](http://vort.org/2007/10/31/protect-your-noodle/).

It's not up on their web site yet. I'll update with a link one they post
it.

>  Title: When road design gets personal Author: Russell Neches
>
> Two years ago my little sister was riding her bicycle to a friend's
> house. A woman was diving home from work. They met when the car hit
> Anna at 30 mph.
>
> Before I go further, Anna is OK.
>
> The weeks following the accident were hard. Aphasia, hematoma, and
> dental prosthesis became a regular part of family conversation. It was
> a month before we were sure she would get better.
>
> Anna lives in Norman, Oklahoma. Norman is a lot like Davis; it's
> roughly the same size, population and distance from the state capital.
> Norman hosts a big university and encourages bicycling.
>
> After the accident, I desperately wanted someone to take
> responsibility. At first, I blamed Anna for not being more careful.
> Then I read the police report, and blamed the driver. But when I
> visited Norman and stood by the splashes of dried blood on the
> asphalt, I found I couldn't blame either of them. The blame belonged
> to the road itself.
>
> In sharp contrast to Davis, Norman has some of the sloppiest road
> design in America. The road where the accident happened has no curb,
> no sidewalk, no lane markings, no lights, and no center divider. The
> street is a smear of asphalt that informally fades into gravel and
> scrubby grass on its way to becoming front yard. This wasn't some
> lonely country road. It happened downtown, right next to the
> University of Oklahoma. The equivalent spot in Davis might be about
> Seventh and E Streets. Until Anna's face slammed into the windshield,
> the driver had no way of knowing for sure that she was driving on the
> wrong side of the road.
>
> Davis does a pretty good job when it comes to road design. Even out
> amongst the farms, most of the roads have reflectorized lines to mark
> the center and shoulders. This isn't because paint is cheaper in
> California. It's because public officials have found that the lines
> help people be safer drivers.
>
> With Anna's final round of reconstructive surgery still in the works,
> I hope I can be forgiven for being preoccupied with bicycle safety.
> I'm a scientist. When scientists get worried, we go back to the data.
> Mapping the last couple of years of Davis accident reports indicates
> that the biggest problem spot in our town is the much-debated Fifth
> Street corridor.
>
> It has been proposed to transform the stretch of Fifth Street north of
> downtown from a higher-speed four-lane road with frequent stops into a
> lower-speed two-lane road with center turn pockets. The design would
> look somewhat like B Street does now. I was surprised to learn that
> the two roads carry about the same amount of traffic.
>
> Not everyone likes the idea, and some warn that slowing traffic may
> result in congestion. This must be taken seriously, and so detailed
> computer models have been constructed. The models show that the
> proposed design would actually increase throughput and reduce
> congestion somewhat.
>
> This counterintuitive result is something with which I have personal
> experience. I grew up in Los Angeles, the poster city for congestion.
> It got that way because people tried to solve congestion problems by
> adding lanes. What we got for our billions of dollars was even worse
> congestion. LA has more acreage under roads than under destinations,
> and yet it is still asphyxiated.
>
> Roads are ancient technology. Roman engineers would find California's
> freeways impressive, but would learn little from them. But even
> ancient technology can be improved. We didn't get from swinging stone
> axes to landing robots on Mars by refusing to try new things. Lane
> reduction has been tried in other cities, with great results for
> safety and efficiency.
>
> The proposed Fifth Street design sounds like something worth trying.
> It will make Davis a safer, more efficient place walk, bike and drive.
> Repainting and installing different signals is part of the normal
> process of maintaining and improving roads. The proposal would simply
> guide this process. If it doesn't work, the city has more paint. My
> family learned the hard way just how important lines of paint really
> are.
>
> I've made an interactive map at vort.org/media/data/crashes.html
> displaying the last couple of years of Davis accident data. I hope it
> will inspire you think about how our roads are designed, how those
> designs succeed, and how they can be improved.
