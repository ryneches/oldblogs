Summary: 


North Korea evidently tested a nuclear weapon today. USGS reports a
magnitude 4.2 earthquake today at +41&deg; 18' 41.04", +129&deg; 6' 51.84". So
much for George Bush's "muscular" foreign policy.

People have been worrying about the consequences of a nuclear North
Korea for a very long time. The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists will
probably have to move the [Doomsday
Clock](http://www.thebulletin.org/doomsday_clock/timeline.htm) back to
two minutes from midnight, where it was in 1953. From a diplomacy point
of view, this is a d disaster of the first order.

If this were the only example of the failure of our "muscular" foreign
policy, it would be bad enough. But the North Korea's acquisition of
nuclear weapons is far from the only disaster precipitated by George
Bush's cognitive dwarfism. The Bush Doctrine has provoked Iran into
reactivating its own nuclear weapons program. Likewise, the official
policy of openly promoting regime change via a "Velvet Revolution" in
Iran has triggered a brutal crackdown on the very groups that were meant
to lead this revolution. For Time Magazine, Adadeh Moaveni [writes from
Tehran](http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1543706,00.html):

Iran, whose demographics had been quietly eroding the foundation of
totalitarian clerical rule, has now crushed the very forces the Bush
Doctrine was counting on to champion Iran's transition from tyranny. In
Iran, "muscular" foreign policy has reinvigorated tyranny and terror and
placed both on the fast track to nuclear weapons.

It would appear that the lessons being dealt our military and diplomatic
establishment are simply not being learned. George Bush presided today
at the christening of the 6-billion-dollar nuclear powered Nimitz
aircraft carrier, named in honor of his father, George H.W. Bush. At one
fifth of a mile long, the Nimitz class aircraft carriers are indeed the
greatest warships ever built. And now we have ten of them :

-   USS Nimitz
-   USS Dwight D. Eisenhower
-   USS Carl Vinson
-   USS Theodore Roosevelt
-   USS Abraham Lincoln
-   USS George Washington
-   USS John C. Stennis
-   USS Harry S. Truman
-   USS Ronald Reagan
-   USS George H. W. Bush

Why do we need ten of them? Nuclear aircraft carriers are profoundly
unsutable for combating the non-state threats with whom we are
supposedly locked in mortal combat. Even if you set aside the inherent
sillyness of fighting a "war" with an abstract concept like "terrorism,"
exactly what use do we have for a nuclear powered aircraft carrier?
Under which doctrine was the decision made that we need ten? The
Doctrine of Maximum Cost for Minimum Benefit? What new and exciting
countries do we need to bomb into submission -- or, since this is the
real world, bomb into eternal bitterness and resentment?

And of course, Iraq. There is always Iraq. For three years, George Bush
has left our military there to rot. We will probably have to rebuild it
from the ground up. We will need to expand and reform the V.A. to take
care of the tens of thousands of maimed and debilitated (not to mention
the thousands of abandoned Vietnam War veterans). We will have to
re-train the officer corps so that they will know how to avoid the
mistakes that led to Abu Ghraib. The role defense contractors play in
our armed forces has grown to resemble that of maggots feeding on a
barely living creature. Extracting the parasites, excising the dead
tissue and and healing the wounds left behind will be a generation-long
process. Iraq has demonstrated that a small, mobile and coordinated army
is an effective destroyer of nations. We have none of the appropriate
tools for *building* nations (or, more likely, rebuilding them). We will
have to re-imagine the enlistment process and bulk up the ranks. Six
billion dollar Nimitz class aircraft carriers will not help.

The whole idea of muscular foreign policy stems from a failure to think
beyond the reach of one's own actions. It only makes sense if the
response of the rest of the world was predictably linear with our
application of force. We need a certain amount of bend, so we push with
a certain force, and the world responds as expected. The world is
essentially static, and need only push and pull it to achieve our
desired results. Unfortunately, this view fails to recognize that the
rest of the world has *people in it*. People resist when you push them.
They fight when you challenge them. They attack when you provoke them.
Applying the concept of muscular foreign policy is a bit like playing
chess without realizing that your opponent gets to move their pieces
too.

Then again, if the world were a chess game, George Bush has demonstrated
repeatedly that he's never figured out how the horsey moves.
