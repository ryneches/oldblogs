Summary: 


Thanks to [a rather poorly organized security
update](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2006/8/9/rails-1-1-5-mandatory-security-patch-and-other-tidbits)
on the part of the Ruby on Rails team (and a healthy dose of
Oh-Fuck-I-Don't-Have-Time-For-This), Vort.org has been down for a day or
so. It's back now. I'm using one of the new included themes for Typo
because the latest version of Typo doesn't like my custom theme, and I
really don't want to mess with CSS right now.

Special thanks to [Chris](http://www.clambert.org) for setting me
straight on database migration.
