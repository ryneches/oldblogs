Summary: 


Sadly, even as more and more businesses are becoming savvy to the idea
that open communication empowers employees more than it distracts them,
there are still a lot of employers who just **love** blocking ports and
banning websites. It probably isn't even a management decision. It's
just something the IT department does to make their own lives easier.

Not that I don't sympathize. Keeping any significant number of PCs free
of malware is difficult enough when your user base can't install
software. I just don't think the jack-booted thug approach serves the
interests of employees or the company very well.

So, if you are unfortunate enough to live or work someplace that blocks
SSH, and/or you cannot install an SSH client, there is a solution. If
you have a server somewhere, just install
[AjaxTerm](http://antony.lesuisse.org/qweb/trac/wiki/AjaxTerm). Then you
can log into a cute little AJAX terminal using an ordinary web browser
(don't forget to use SSL). The terminal itself is surprisingly snappy.
It is even snappier over SSL. It's not quite as interactive as a local
xterm, but it's quite usable. It's a bit like using a 2400 baud modem.

It's dead-simple to install, too.
