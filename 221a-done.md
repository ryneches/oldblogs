Summary: 


I just finished the Quantum exam, and I feel awful. The exam questions
bore only rudimentary resemblance to problems we did in the homework or
in class. They also bore little resemblance to the material on which the
TA and the professor suggested that we focus.

I suppose it would have been just fine if this were the tenth time I'd
done this class, which is probably why it seemed reasonable to the
professor. As it is, I just have to hope that the rest of the class is
about as miffed as me, and hope that my 94% homework average will keep
me above the cutoff for an A.
