Summary: 


Interesting thing of the day : If you
[plug](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&q=%22gctagttaaa+aaaggaaatt+catacccaaa%22&btnG=Search)
the following nucleotide sequence into Google :

    "gctagttaaa aaaggaaatt catacccaaa"

The only hit you will find is the Swine Flu genome. Google is a sequence
homology tool!
