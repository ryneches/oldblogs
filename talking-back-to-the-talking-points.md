Summary: 


I normally avoid reading Republican blogs. This isn't an ideological
choice -- there are a few *conservative* bloggers who I find quite
informative. Somehow, thought, [this caught my
eye](http://asmba.typepad.com/veterans/):

> Republicans blast back in response to comments made by the Senate
> Majority Leader Harry Reid about the war in Iraq. OK, I get it,
> Senator Reid doesn't like the war and probably does not like President
> Bush. But will someone please tell me the benefit of spouting off in
> public to the news media that the war in Iraq is lost.

Yes, I can tell you *exactly* what the benefit is. If we have lost the
war, and by all objective measures we have indeed lost the war, then it
is *absolutely imperative* to "spout off in public" about this fact.
That is the only way anything can be done about it. Harry Reid is one of
the leaders of our country, and so it is his responsibility to lead,
both on the day-to-day business of running the government and also by
shaping the national dialog. It is his solemn, sworn *duty* as a servant
of the public to spout off about it.

I'll set aside the author's conceit that one can really know the mind of
Harry Reid, or anyone else, well enough to guess their likes and
dislikes. It has nothing to do with whether or not he "likes" the war or
"likes" the president. A man in Harry Reid's position has very little
time to entertain his own likes and dislikes. When the stakes are that
high, personal likes and dislikes are irrelevant. There is only room for
cold analytical judgment. People have different priorities and different
theories, and so judgment varies. Harry Reid judges the war lost, due in
large part to the president's incompetence. Most Americans came to the
same conclusion more than a year ago.

You may of course disagree with Mr. Reid. Maybe you think the war is
going great. We are each entitled to draw our own conclusions. But what
sort of thinking would lead you to question the soundness of Mr. Reid's
decision to publicly state *his* conclusion?

> If I was a soldier on the ground in Iraq, I'd be questioning the next
> time I'm out on patrol just what the ... am I doing out here?

So, basically, you argue that Mr. Reid's remarks might cause our
soldiers to question their mission, and so he should apologize. Utter
nonsense. If they can handle being shot at, then they're tough enough
not to be vexed by a argument a dozen steps up the chain of command. A
responsible commander doesn't make strategic decisions based solely on
the supposed anxieties of the rank and file.

In any event, from what I am given to understand, our solders *have*
been wondering what the fuck they are doing in Iraq since they got
there. I include the word "fuck," rather than an coy little ellipsis
meant to stand it its place, because that is exactly how a soldier on
the ground in Iraq right now would phrase it.

> People around the world (especially in Iraq) who don't completely

Rubbish. We have already lost all ability to garner support in Iraq. We
lost that about two months into the operation. We lost our ability to
garner support everywhere else before we even invaded. The Iraqis want
us to leave immediately, and the rest of the world never wanted us to go
there in the first place. If anything, Mr. Reid's remarks have boosted
our support in Iraq and around the world simply because they are
evidence that America is capable of seeing the obvious truth.

Determination and ability have nothing to do with it. A popular
insurgency cannot be defeated. France discovered this in Algeria, the
Soviet Union discovered this in Afghanistan, and we discovered this in
Vietnam. America was *born* in a popular insurgency against what was
then the most powerful military and economic force in the world. We, of
all nations, should understand the power of an insurgency.

History has shown that the only effective strategy to defeat a popular
insurgency is genocide. This is how successful wars of conquest have
worked for all of recorded history. Insurgencies tend to run out of
steam once a third of the population has been exterminated. If we want
"victory" in Iraq, then that's what we'd have to do. So far, our
intervention in Iraq has killed about 700,000 people (about one in ten
from direct violence). That's about 3% of the population. We can expect
the insurgency to fall apart when we've killed ten times as many people.
What Harry Reid means by "lost" is that the only path to victory
available to us is too horrible to contemplate.

So what does Mr. Dougherty suggest we do?

That's right. He wants America to *literally* get medieval on the
insurgency. So that we can "avoid the ghosts" of Vietnam. So that we can
avoid the embarrassment of admitting that we stuck our national dick
into a meatgrinder. Maybe he hasn't studied enough history to realize
how many people would have to die. Or maybe he has, and doesn't care.

George Bush sent our troops on an impossible mission. As usual, they
have served with exemplary professionalism, but that doesn't change the
fact that it's an impossible mission. He could have ordered them to
invade Atlantis, or build a perpetual motion machine, or exactly express
Pi as a ratio of two integers, and it would be no less impossible. Harry
Reid is saying that it's time to admit that the situation is fucked,
it's time to repudiate the men who caused the mess, and it's time we
brought our kids home.

Shudder away. Starting only days after the attacks on Pearl Harbor, the
Republican minority vocally opposed Roosevelt, the war and the
continuation of the New Deal. They were told not to question the
president in a time of war. They were sternly admonished for undermining
the moral of our troops and giving comfort to the enemy. Robert Taft,
the minority leader, had this to say:

This brings us full circle. Joe wanted to know what the possible benefit
of publicly opposing the war could be. There you have it, Joe, from the
mouth of the Republican minority leader, defending his opposition to the
war you glorify.
