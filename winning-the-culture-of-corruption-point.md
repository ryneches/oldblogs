Summary: 


To beat the Republicans in 2006 and 2008, the best message the Democrats
have is to highlight the corruption of the Republican party. The
Republicans will be unable to refute this accusation, and so their
strategy will be largely based on accusing the Democrats of similar
corruption. To date, the Democratic response to this message has been,
roughly;

-   We're not in power, so how can we be corrupt?
-   We're not corrupt.
-   OK, maybe we've been corrupt, and maybe a few of us still are, but
    we're *way less corrupt*.

I'm exaggerating a bit, but it's not too far from the mark. This is a
lame refutation. We'll need something stronger.

Fortunately, such an argument can be formulated simply by articulating
changes underway in how the Democrats are raising money. Thanks largely
to Howard Dean's leadership at the DNC, the Democratic Party is
transforming into a member-supported party. The best answer to the
too-familiar refrain of false equality on the corruption issue is;

-   Once up on a time, the Democrats and the Republicans financed
    campaigns mostly with money from big lobbing groups. This was how
    corruption seeped into both parties. The Republicans are still
    financed in this way. We are not.
-   If we seize control of Congress, we will take immediate action to
    strengthen ethics rules in the House and Senate. The ethical rules
    we plan to implement are simple, and should be publicized ahead of
    the election as part of the general campaign strategy. We should
    promise to swiftly censure or eject any of our own party who violate
    these rules.
-   Once in control of Congress, if we begin to follow the same pattern
    of corruption now rampant in the Republican party, then we deserve
    to be voted out.
-   The Republicans believe in a double-standard with respect to
    corruption. Some of them have noble goals, but as a group they take
    the attitude that the ends justify the means. And so, they freely
    engage in corrupt and illegal acts, but still condemn any infraction
    on the part of a Democrat with the utmost shrillness. As the
    majority party, Democrats will promise to respect the rules,
    whatever our goals.

When it comes to corruption, we have to articulate how the Democrats are
*fundamentally* different from the Republican party. Arguing matters of
degree isn't good enough. If we don't show a clear, obvious distinction
in the structure of our party, the Republicans will blow their false
equality horn, and they'll win the point.
