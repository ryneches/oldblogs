Summary: 


I'm on the airplane, flying back to L.A. after visiting Mimi in Boston.
The time difference and flying on the red-eye really screwed with my
head, so I was at best three-quarters conscious most of the weekend.
Somewhere along the way, I also managed to see Adam, Billy, Chris, Kevin
and Tom.

Mimi and I had all sorts of ambitious plans for the weekend, but mostly
we ended up sleeping in. I don't think I can imagine a better way to
spend a weekend!

On the downside, I realized I left my shaver and toothbrush in Boston.
Also, my homework failed to do itself, despite the fact that I carried
it around in my backpack all weekend. Maybe I should have shaken it more
vigorously, or something.

Mimi! Hurry up and graduate already!
