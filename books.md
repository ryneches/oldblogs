Summary: 


[Book Burro](http://bookburro.org) is easily the most useful Firefox
extension I have found. People who do a lot of HTML hacking might bestow
that honor on [Web
Developer](http://chrispederick.com/work/webdeveloper/). I don't, so
Book Burro gets my vote.

Oh, and AdBlock, but that's not simply useful. It's necessary.
