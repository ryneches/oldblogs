Summary: 


I'm back in California for twelve hours, and I'm already feeling better.
Mimi picked me up at John Wayne Airport, and her family welcomed me
home. Before I had even put my suitcases down, there was an astonishing
quantity of food on the table. After a good night's sleep and a shower
in an *actual shower*, as opposed to the many and various ersatz showers
available throughout Europe, I am starting to reclaim my humanity.
