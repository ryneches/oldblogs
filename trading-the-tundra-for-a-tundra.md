Summary: 


Only a few day ago, I discovered that my [wonderful Toyota
Yaris](http://vort.org/articles/2006/12/02/new-car) probably
[outranks](http://www.treehugger.com/files/2007/10/overcoming_prius.php)
my mother's (also pretty neat) Toyota Prius in terms of lowest carbon
footprint. It appears the Yaris has the smallest carbon footprint of any
car available in the United States.

Unfortunately, when it comes to fuel economy standards, what Toyota
gives with one hand, it takes away with the other. Thomas Friedman
[expounds in his op-ed
today](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/03/opinion/03friedman.html) :

> What I don't get is *empty-barrel politics* - Michigan lawmakers year
> after year shielding Detroit from pressure to innovate on higher
> mileage standards, even though Detroit's failure to sell more
> energy-efficient vehicles has clearly contributed to its brush with
> bankruptcy, its loss of market share to Toyota and Honda - whose
> fleets beat all U.S. automakers in fuel economy in 2007 - and its loss
> of jobs. G.M. today has 73,000 working U.A.W. members, compared with
> 225,000 a decade ago. Last year, Toyota overtook G.M. as the world's

This is one of the reasons it's a bad idea to allow so few companies to
dominate such an important market. It virtually guarantees that even the
"good guys" to get mixed up in bad business, and no approach actually
taken will stand out as clearly the right one. If there were more car
companies each with a smaller market share, it would be more likely that
at least *one* of them would hit on the right mix of innovation,
marketing and public policy.

Remember, Toyota also makes the unfortunately-named Tundra. Imagine
yourself a future history textbook author in a time when there isn't any
*actual* tundra left in the world. Would *you* pass up the opportunity
to bash a company for naming a product after the ecosystem it helped
erase from the Earth?
