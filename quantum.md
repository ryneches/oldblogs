Summary: 


This is the Runge-Lenz vector. In classical gravitation or coulomb
problems (anything with potential that follows the inverse square law),
it points towards the aphelion.

The Runge-Lenz vector and I do not get along very well. If I didn't know
for a fact that the damn thing was going to come up again when we do the
hydrogen atom, I would curse it forever. However, since I know that
it'll be back, that wouldn't be productive.

I've got my eye on you, Runge-Lenz. Next time, you're going down.
