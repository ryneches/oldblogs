Summary: 


Ikea has a very nice and aptly-named LED lighting product called
[DIODER](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20119932). It has
four lamps, uses about a watt, and nicely illuminates a good-size desk.

I installed one for my mom's microscope workspace. Yes, I'll do
something about the dangling wires when I have time to buy wire-ties.
