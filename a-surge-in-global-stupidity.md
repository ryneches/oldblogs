Summary: 


It looks like CO2 emissions between 2000 and 2004 have increased, which
probably isn't a surprise, but the reason why emission have increased
actually is surprising. [New Scientist

The predictions used to estimate how much CO2 we will spew are based on
the assumption that we will pursue more efficient technology. This is a
reasonable assumption to make, even if there were no environmental
impacts to consider -- more efficient generating technology is more
profitable to operate. Inefficiency is, after all, wasted money. No one
thought that people would be so idiotic as to harm the environment *and*
waste money.

Evidently, up until the year 2000, we were doing OK. Then, suddenly,
there was a surge in CO2 production and a sag in efficiency. One might
characterize it as a surge in stupidity.

Let's see... what happened in 2000 that might have caused a surge in net
global stupidity?
