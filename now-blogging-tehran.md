Dear Iranian Security Forces:

Welcome to Vort.org, now from Tehran. Please spend as much time looking
at this page as possible. There are lots and lots of links to follow.
Who knows what important security information you will find? It is very
important that you read every single post on this blog. Carefully. And
discuss each of them with your superiors.

I may have scattered the names and locations of many *active dissidents*
in old posts on my blog. Then again, maybe I haven't. You won't know
until you look. Please take your time.

You can be from Tehran too:
