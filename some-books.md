Summary: 


I've had unusually good luck picking books to read in the last few
weeks, and I thought I would share my thoughts about a few of them. I
don't really want to review them, because I think reviews are boring. If
you want to know what a book is about, then read it. These are my
unsubstantiated opinions.

-   *The Windup Girl*, Paolo Bacigalupi
    One of the most interesting and difficult challenges for
    contemporary science fiction writers is imagining the world after
    oil. Paolo Bacigalupi offers what I think is probably the most
    serious effort so far, though I think his calibration of
    technological progress (or lack thereof) is based more on media
    zeitgeist that anything else. Bacigalupi imagines an energy economy
    that has collapsed to human muscle power set alongside biotechnology
    of almost arbitrary power. It makes for a very unique world, and he
    accomplishes some pretty excellent storytelling. The story layers
    melancholy reflection with fast-paced action, but remains tightly
    cohesive.

-   *Ship Breaker*, Paolo Bacigalupi
    
    *Ship Breaker* seems to be set in the same world as *The Windup
    Girl*, but follows a single protagonist, rather than a cast of
    characters. *Ship Breaker* paints Bacigalupi's imagined history in
    clear strokes, whereas *The Windup Girl* paints it with hints,
    unexplained references, and frayed ends that the reader must patch
    together on their own. *Ship Breaker* is more brutal but less bleak.

-   *For the Win*, Cory Doctorow
    
    If you've ever played video games, you need to read this book. If
    you've ever read anything by Howard Zinn, you need to read this
    book. If you were paying any kind of attention to the Financial
    Crisis, you need to read this book.
    
    *For the Win* is a battle between two brilliant economists, a labor
    organizer from India and a Stanford-dropout quant from America.
    Doctorow highlights the astute observation that game economies are
    steadily becoming larger and more sophisticated, while the
    proliferation of credit default swaps, collateralized debt
    obligations and other various unregulated instruments have made our
    financial system more like a giant video game. They are linked;
    Doctorow merely imagines the link has grown deeper and more complex.
    The battleground of the book is the murky, crime-ridden middle
    ground shared by hedge fund managers, dark knights, child laborers,
    derivatives traders, Chinese crime bosses, bored American teenagers,
    and hundred-foot-tall zombie death robots. It's brilliant.

-   *Generation A*, Douglas Coupland
    
    I never know if I should classify Coupland with Don DeLillo or with
    Neal Stephenson. His books thrive on the knife's edge between
    postmodernist absurdism applied to reality, and literate, profane
    realism applied to science fiction. Postmodernism places the rupture
    with reality in the interpretation of the world, and science fiction
    places the rupture in the world itself. Coupland's narratives exist
    somewhere between these two, and the effect is like looking into
    someone's eyes from up close, when the parallax is big enough that
    you waver from one eye to the other. The rupture slips back and
    forth between the interpretation and the world, and the effect is
    delightful.

-   *City at the End of Time*, Greg Bear

    This book is worth reading for the atmosphere alone. The plot is an
    introspective adventure across dreams and time, and but the texture
    is what really sells it. If you appreciated the textured melancholy
    in *Lord of the Rings* or *The Silmarillion*, then *City at the End
    of Time* is definitely worth reading. Greg Bear raises the stakes
    and invokes the senses in a very different way, but the mood is like
    a Tolkien piece.
    
    A common theme in literature is the cruelty of time and decay. *City
    at the End of Time* confronts this directly, emphasizing the joy of
    time and change, and the horror of the alternative. Like Tolkien,
    the atmosphere creates a kind of intense nostalgia for the here and
    now.

-   *The Android's Dream*, John Scalzi
    
    John Scalzi must have enjoyed writing this book enormously, and it
    shows. Every couple of pages culminates in a laugh-out-loud idea.
    It's brazenly ridiculous, but isn't as manic as Douglas Adams or
    Terry Pratchett. Scalzi seems to enjoy building up his absurdities
    into towering edifices, rather than sprinkling them around. They're
    not just funny in themselves; they're funny because Scalzi manages
    to pull them off.

-   *The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks*, Rebecca Skloot

    This is probably one of the most important books of the year.
    Rebecca Skloot is thoughtful, compassionate and brilliant, and she
    put more than a decade of work into this slim little book. If it
    were fiction, it would be a brilliant accomplishment, but this is as
    real as it gets. This is a beautiful personal narrative, an ethics
    lesson, a call to action, a carefully documented historical account,
    an adventure, a science lesson, and a cogent critique of the culture
    of medical practice and research. If Skloot had pulled off only one
    or two of those things, this would still have been a brilliant book.

    It is clear that she cares deeply about the Lacks family, and when
    you're done with this book, so will you.
