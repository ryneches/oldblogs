Summary: 


Just a few days after hearing that [Pierre's
paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2005.12.005) is finally in press
(I'm the third author), I'm starting work on my first real paper. I
finally have my software for the project working more or less correctly,
so I can actually start writing the paper (since I know what I can
actually do now). Holy Hell, this took a long time. I can't wait to
start working on new stuff, but I've got to get this out the door first.
With any luck, I'll have a draft ready for my adviser when he gets back
from his trip.
