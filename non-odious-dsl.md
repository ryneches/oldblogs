Summary: 


Well, now that Speakeasy has been acquired by Best Buy, I'm going to
give up on it. I had such high hopes, but now I feel like an asshole for
ever recommending them. The customer service has been rude and unhelpful
(to my mother, no less!), the installation was painful, it's overpriced,
and the actual service is miserably slow. And by slow, I mean like
*dial-up* slow.

One thing I liked about dial-up service was the profusion of choices.
There were dozens, and in some places, hundreds of ISPs. The ISPs
offered lots of features and competitive prices. Now, the "choice"
usually boils down to :

-   Your friendly local cable monopoly, or
-   Your friendly local telephone monopoly

Not unexpectedly, we pay high prices for crappy service. The monopolist
providers cheerfully spy on us on behalf of quasi-legitimate
entertainment cartels and clearly illegal government programs.

I want my choices back. There are a lot of smallish local DSL providers
in LA, like [Pacific Online](http://www.pon.net) and [LA
Bridge](http://www.labridge.com). Has anyone out there had any
experiences (good or bad) with smaller DSL providers?
