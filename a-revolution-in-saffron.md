Summary: 


The police in Burma are [firing warning
shots](http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/09/26/myanmar.protest.ap/index.html)
and arresting the monks who are defying a ban on public gatherings. I
was literally holding my breath listening to the BBC reporting from
Rangoon.

I first studied Burma when I was a freshman in high school. Burma was
the topic in policy debate that I dreaded the most; just thinking about
it put me on the verge of tears. Even today, I find it utterly
impossible to say anything rational about the situation there.

Much of humanity is sustained through its daily misery by the hope that
evil can be defeated without resorting to evil. We all hope that
somehow, someone will figure out a way.

If I believed in God, I would pray for Burma.
