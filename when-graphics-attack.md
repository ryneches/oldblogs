Summary: 


As the results from my big calculation roll in, I've been putting
together some of the plots that will go into the paper. Some have turned
out pretty good. Others have yielded some good results after a bit of
work. Others.... well...

I'm not even going to bother describing what it is, and I have
deliberately deleted the scales. It's damn near impossible to interpret
anything from this monstrosity. I'm not even sure what to make of it,
even though I am completely familiar with the data it came from, the
scale, the significance of the different traces, and the plotting
methodology. It is pure junk.

Worst of all, it is ugly junk. It looks like it belongs in the lobby of
a dingy vintage 1977 office building. I'm still trying to work out a way
to display this data that doesn't make your head explode.

I can't believe I thought this would be a good idea.
