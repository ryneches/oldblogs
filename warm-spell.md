Summary: 


I was biking to the gym yesterday, and it occured to me that since it
was so beautiful outside, I may as well just keep biking. So, instead of
sitting on the stationary bike, I did a three and a half hour ride down
some random county road. It was awesome, even with my funny little
commuter bike.

Along the way I passed this pathway planted with olive trees through the
middle of one of the UC Davis research farms.

Note to self: Plant more olive trees.
