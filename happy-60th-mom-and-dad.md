about the individuals who raised me. I can proudly confirm that they are
every bit as odd as I am. Anyway, they both turned sixty in the last
couple of weeks (my mom in December, and my dad a few days ago), and I
wanted to post a little celebration of our great family tradition of
crossgrainedness.

For my mom's birthday, she and my sister came over and slept on the
floor of my apartment in Davis, despite the availability of perfectly
comfortable and reasonably priced lodgings downtown. For her birthday,
we found a fetid puddle of water near [Lake
Berryessa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Berryessa) with some

Bruce is a professor of mathematics at the University of Illinois. He
studies the identities of high-order polynomials. So, this really is the
a birthday card only he would think to send.
