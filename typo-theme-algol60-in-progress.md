Summary: 


As you might have noticed, I'm working on a new theme for Vort.org that
I've decided to call ALGOL60, in honor of [the venerable language of
yore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algol_60). It's still very much a
work in progress, but it's starting to look somewhat promising. At the
moment, I'm just modifying the Azure theme that comes with Typo. If that
hinders progress, I'll start over from scratch.
