Summary: 


There is a group that is [putting together a presidential
debate](http://www.sciencedebate2008.com) specifically focused on
science. I think the idea is that it would come after the primaries, so
it would be among nominated candidates. How cool would this be?

> **Moderator** : Senator, on the issue of dark matter, you have...
>
> **Clinton** : Read my lips: No. New. Particles.
>
> **Moderator** : I see. Mr. Huckabee, what is your position on dark
> matter? Do you agree with the Senator's assertion that it is baryonic
> in nature?
>
> **Huckabee** : No, no I do not. If it were baryonic, it would interact
> strongly with light, and we would be able to see it. Then it wouldn't
> be dark matter, would it? No, I believe that we are facing something
> new and terrible; an abomination to those of us who actually *obey*
> the Pauli Exclusion Principle. That is why I have a four-point-plan
> for eliminating the scourge of dark matter from the universe.

> **Clinton** : This is exactly the sort of misplaced priorities that
> I've been talking about. How can we be talking about non-baryonic dark
> matter when we don't even know the properties of the Higgs? What if
> there is no Higgs boson, and the whole supersymmetric model goes out

> only a few TeV, and these non-baryonic particles aren't heavy enough
> to explain the non-observable mass in the universe? Or what if the
> Higgs is hundreds of TeV, and the supersymmetric particles are too
> rare? We don't have the answers to these questions. This whole

Seriously, though, whoever wins the nominations, I would just love see
this sort of debate.
