Summary: 


[I agree with Travis](http://sadlyno.com/archives/003142.html) agreeing
with [William
Arkin](http://blog.washingtonpost.com/earlywarning/2006/06/the_hero_of_guantanamo.html)
agreeing with Lt. Cmdr. Charles Swift. *Hamden v. Rumsfeld* will be
remembered as one stepping stone among many in America's long path to
form a more perfect Union. Hamden may be a rat, but then again he may
not. The Supreme Court reminds us that this is America. We don't abide
kangaroo courts and secret justice.

I'll toast to that. Happy 230th, America.
