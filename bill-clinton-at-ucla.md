Summary: 


I went to see Bill Clinton speak at the sculpture garden at UCLA today.
The rally was for [California Proposition 87](http://www.yeson87.org/).
The speech was not one of Clinton's best, not was it really appropriate
for the venue. I'm sure everyone cares that exposure to air pollution
increases the risks of developing asthma, and the parents should be very
worried about their children. However, the audience consisted almost
completely of undergraduate college students. "Think about your
children!" isn't the most appropriate way to frame the argument.

Despite miscalculating a bit on the appropriate tone given the audience,
did make some very good points. First of all, and perhaps most
importantly, the proposal isn't any kind of innovation. It is simply an
implementation of an extraction tax, which is a revenue vehicle used in
many US states -- Arkansas is one of them. Texas also collects drilling
fees. The impact of the extraction tax on gasoline prices in Arkansas
and Texas is non-existent, since the price for crude is set by the
market, and is not dependent on local variations in the cost of
extraction. So, the tax might raise oil prices in general, but only to
the extent that the price of California oil figures into the global
market for oil (which is to say, not very much).

Unlike extraction taxes in most other places, Prop 87 would set aside
the money specifically for funding research in alternative energy. The
research would be conducted here in California. In that respect, it has
a bit in common with the stem cell research fund created by California
voters when they approved Proposition 71 in 2004.

Clinton concluded by pointing out that the gasoline-powered internal
combustion engine has remained pretty much the same for the last hundred
years, despite the existence of less problematic technologies. He
wrapped up the speech by saying that in the 20th century, California has
usually lead the nation (and the world) in the generation of new
technologies, and that this proposal would continue that tradition.

Sounds good to me.
