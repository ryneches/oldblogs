Summary: 


Here is a conundrum. Suppose you want to measure growth rates of
bacterial cultures in an aerobic environment, on LB, in 96-well plate
format. So, you buy some plates from your favorite supplier, and program
them dispense some LB into the wells with a multichannel pipetter,
inoculate from whatever your source is, and pop it into your plate
reader and start the program.

Now, what do you do if your plate reader was installed upside down? Your
media will spill out and get all over the expensive bits inside the
machine, and your PI will become sad and despondent. You could perhaps
put the plate in upside down too, and that might solve the problem. What
if the instrument randomly changes its orientation as the experiment
proceeds? Or worse yet, what if the instrument is permanently in free
fall? What then, kemosabe?

One would think, I suppose, that NASA has a thing for that. And you
would be correct, to a point. The problem is that the thing in question
is not ready yet, and the experiment is going ahead without the thing.
So, here is your mission, should you choose to accept it : Design a cup
that doesn't spill when it is open.

I must admit I toyed with the idea of 3D printing an [array of Klein
bottles](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4328), but settled on
fabricating plates out of acrylic and PDMS. I'm relying on the strong
hydrophobicity of PDMS to prevent liquid from entering the ventilation
ports.

The International Space Station needs to maintain very strict controls
on volatile compounds off gassed from they bring aboard, which means
rules out a lot of useful things, like pretty much every glue you can
think of. So, another advantage of PDMS is that it is food safe. In
fact, it is an ingredient in many cosmetics and foods, [including
McDonald's Chicken
McNuggets](http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2010/06/25/a-tale-of-2-nuggets/).
Now, the idea of eating silicone elastomer, the same material used in
the [front shock absorber on my mountain
bike](http://www.vintagecannondale.com/cannondale/headshok/headshok.html),
may not sound appetizing, but it there is [pretty good evidence that it
is at least not demonstrably
harmful](http://www.inchem.org/documents/jecfa/jecmono/v06je42.htm). So,
that should hopefully keep us well clear of toxicological issues.

I'll wrap up with a poem from my childhood.

> Three jolly sailors from Blaydon-on-Tyne\
>  They went to sea in a bottle by Klein.\
>  Since the sea was entirely inside the hull\
>  The scenery seen was exceedingly dull.\
