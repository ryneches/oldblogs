Earlier today, I received a request to use [one of the photographs I've
posted on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rneches/2081925733/). I
get a lot of these requests, and I always find them a bit annoying; I
release all of my photographs (and writing, including this blog) under a
Creative Commons Attribution license.

I would be delighted if people emailed to say, "Hey, thanks for letting
me use your photo! Here's a link to what the thing I'm using it for."
Even that isn't strictly necessary, since I always notice the inbound
referrals from the attribution links. The whole point is that you don't
need to ask permission because you already have it, provided you give
proper attribution. So, as usual, I tried to explain this concept, and
got an interesting answer.

Wait, he wants me to waive the CC-BY license just so they can avoid
actually linking to the original photo in the credit? That doesn't make
a bit of sense. Yes, I want credit for my work, but that's not why I
licence under CC-BY. Even if something is in the public domain, nobody
has the right to plagiarize from it, and an author can and should expect
their public domain works to be properly credited. You can *copy* it,
and you can cut it into bits, rearrange the bits, paint the whole mess
orange and trade for a silly hat. However, you cannot claim you created
the original, because, well, you didn't. That would be fraud.

The reason I use CC-BY instead of Public Domain is because it requires
anyone using my work to provide *useful* attribution information. This
is basically the same standard of attribution used in science.
Scientists have to cite the work of others in such a way that the reader
can actually identify and obtain the cited material for themselves. It's
about *access*, not just credit.

So, I try to explain...

I was hopeful that this would click. There tons of easy things they
could do to house the links. They could make a page on their website
somewhere that said "attributions page for exhibit X" with a list of
photos and attribution links. It would just take a few minutes, and it
would be useful.

But alas, no.

Think about this here. He says, "I'm not going to be able to accommodate
your request." Remember who's requesting what here. He really means,
"I'm not going to be able to *comply with the terms of your license.*"

So, I'm pretty disappointed. I don't care if they use my photo or not. I
get thousands of views already. My photos get used for lots of things,
including a couple of elementary school science textbooks in developing
countries. The publishers didn't have any problem putting a link next to
my name.

No, I'm disappointed that the Los Angeles Natural History Museum doesn't
seem to understand why citations are important.
