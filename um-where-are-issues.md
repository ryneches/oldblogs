Summary: 


I thought the whole point of nominating John McCain was that he was
supposed to be the honerable candidate, and that he would take on the
issues with the Democratic nominee. You remember the issues, right? Our
assorted wars, our collapsing banking system, forclosures, the energy
clusterfuck, torture, wiretapping, abortion, global warming, gay rights,
taxes, the budget -- that stuff.

So, uh, when is he going to get into that stuff? He is seriously going
to talk about Paris Hilton? WTF?
