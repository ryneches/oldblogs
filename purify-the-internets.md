Summary: 


Hu Jintao wants to [cleanse the Internet of objectionable
material](http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSPEK8130920070423).
Evidently, the Internet is full of foul language, pornography, and worst
of all, [upsetting politics](http://www.freetibet.org/) and [strange
spiritual stuff](http://www.fofg.org/). On one hand, I feel a great deal
of sympathy for the Chinese people, who will see their hard-earned cash
wasted on an initiative that will only serve to brutalize them.

China's Internet policy is already responsible for the political
incarceration of large numbers of Chinese citizens, most of whom are
probably staunch patriots (perhaps with unpopular opinions, though).
Expanding state control over the Internet will only accelerate this. To
some extent, human nature is irreducibly subversive. It is a necessary
part of healthy human psychology to be somewhat resentful of authority.
Resentment of authority is a necessary aspect of self-preservation.
Increasing state surveillance will *of course* turn up more subversive
thinking. Perfect surveillance would reveal that all of us are
subversives, and the remaining few who are not suffer from serious
cognitive disabilities. So, if Hu Jintao wants to lock down the
Internet, he's going to have to lock up an awful lot of people.

On the other hand, as a patriot of my own country, Hu Jintao's calls to
"purify" the Internet bring a smile to my face. If China is successful
in its efforts, which is no certain thing, they will destroy their own
patch of the Internet. Sure, they will still have a high-tech national
computer network, but it won't be the Internet with a capital "I." It
will be something else -- something much, much less valuable. No
interesting services will survive on this "purified" Internet. The
content will be just as interesting and as valuable as Party-controlled
television. Meanwhile, Americans can continue building new and
interesting things.

America has ceded its dominance in industry after industry to China. Hu
Jintao's "purified" Internet is a guarantee that America will keep its
dominance of Internet technologies. Unless, of course, our [indigenous
Internet purifiers](http://stevens.senate.gov/public/) succeed.
