Summary: 


A friendly reminder to those who are following the nomination process:
Party primaries are *not* national elections. Political parties are
essentially private clubs. Subject to a few basic limitations (e.g.,
*Brown v. Board of Education*), they can make up whatever rules they
like. If the Democratic Party wants to select the presidential nominee
via a dance-off, or a hip-hop battle, or an egg toss, that is perfectly
legal.

I keep reading about how the party *isn't allowed* to take away Florida
and Michigan's delegates. Of course they can; it's a private club. In
fact, their rules stipulate that they *must* strip the delegates in this
circumstance.

It's obvious to everyone that the nomination process isn't perfectly
equitable, but the system we have now is a huge improvement over the
smoke-filled-room method of the very recent past. Hillary Clinton has
raised some important objections to how the system works. That's good.
It needs improvement. However, winning the nomination and fixing the
nominating system *should not be conflated*. This is her party, after
all. She's been extremely influential in the party for almost sixteen
years. If she wants to advocate for reforming the process, then she was
welcome to spend some of those sixteen years of influence, you know,
influencing. After the election is over, if she uses her influence to
push for reform, that would be a great service to the party and to the
nation. But pushing for reform in order to win isn't good for anyone.

I should point out that the general election system isn't exactly
perfect either. Any competent candidate must demonstrate the technical
abilities needed to campaign and win, fair and square, even in a system
that is unfair and warped. I should also add that the Democratic
nomination process and the general election process closely approximate
a fair and equitable system, to a precision of a percent or thereabouts.

Elections are political instrumentation. They measure the prefrences of
large groups of people. Say, for example, that you take a measurement
with a volt meter. It reads 5.13V, plus or minus 0.5%. It's not
acceptable to write down 5.17V because you think the probe contacts are
a little dirty, and that's throwing off the measurement. However good
your intuition and experience, that's called fudging your numbers. If
doesn't change the results, then a little fudging won't do much harm,
even if it is bad methodology. If it does change the results, then it's
fraud. Bad scientist. No tenure.
