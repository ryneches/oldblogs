Summary: 


Here are a couple of random cool things that aren't quite enough for a
post on their own, so I'll stick them together.

It's been absurdly hot in Davis. Since the summer started, I've lost
about nine days of productivity on account of my brain being too hot to
function. By the time I get to the heavily air conditioned Genome Center
building, I spend the rest of the day wanting to stick my head in a
bucket of ice water.

Happily, the evenings tend to be very pleasant. And no, I'm not going to
take [Nate Silver up on his
challenge](http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2009/07/challenge-to-climate-change-skeptics.html).
Good on you, Nate.

On Saturday, the [Mondavi Center](http://www.mondaviarts.org/)
[hosted](http://www.mondaviarts.org/events/event.cfm?event_id=803&season=2009)
[Dengue Fever](http://www.myspace.com/denguefevermusic) for a free
concert on the quad. They are really great live! Chhom Nimol got all the
little kids in the audience to come up on stage and dance. It was a
great show.

My labmate Lizzy just adopted an adorable rescue puppy of unknown origin
named Dweezil. He is very sweet, and already very well adapted to life
with humans. He seems to love everybody, but Lizzy especially.

Meanwhile, my own rescue animals continue to puzzle me. Why does Buzz
like to sleep behind my monitor? It's hot, and the cutter on the tape
dispenser keeps poking him in the head and causing him to emit annoyed
grumbling noises and squirm around. There are lots of comfy places he
could sleep, but he likes this spot for some reason.
