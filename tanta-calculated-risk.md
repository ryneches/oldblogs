Summary: 


One of my [favorite
bloggers](http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/11/sad-news-tanta-passes-away.html)
died on Sunday. I didn't know anything about her personal life until
today. She was fighting ovarian cancer with a poor prognosis, and died
at 47. Her obit is in the New York Times.

She was probably the clearest, most readable and best informed voice on
the mortgage crisis, period. She was also pretty much the only person
who had anything positive or funny to say about it. Or, at least she set
mood for the general commentary at "dry wit," when it easily could have
been "catatonic depression."

From her platform as a co-blogger on [Calculated
Risk](http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/), she wowed people from Nobel
laureates to analysts at the Federal Reserve. Pretty much everything I
know about the details of the mortgage crisis I either know because she
explained it to me, or because she explained it to someone else I read
(e.g., certain Nobel laureate economists).

She had hoped to return to mortgage banking after the crisis and after
recovering from cancer, but she made such a mark with her writing over
the last two years that most people doubt that would have been possible.

One thing that makes big media so stupid is that they always turn to the
same stable of pundits for commentary on complex issues. Unfortunately,
most of these guys are not very bright and not very informed. But there
is a solution. For every issue, even issues as murky and choked with
dull tedium as the mortgage banking industry, there are people like
Tanta. She was an expert straight from the trenches, but with a view
broader than anyone could see from the ivory towers of academia or the
skyscraper corner offices of industry. She was exactly the sort of
person that major media outlets should recruit for beat reporting. The
murkier the issue, the brighter such people can shine.

Alas, this particular glimmer in the gloom has gone out.
