Summary: 


Los Angeles is famous for our videotapes of our police beating the shit
out of defenseless people. Now UCLA is famous for our video of our
campus police tasering students. The LAPD has been operating under
special judicial review since the Rodney King incident. Effectively, the
whole department is on probation. But that hasn't stopped them from
beating people up on camera.

UCLA should fire these guys. Never mind the moral impartive; they are a
threat to the academic environment of the university.
