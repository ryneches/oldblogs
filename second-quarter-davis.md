Summary: 


This quarter, I'm taking :

-   **Mathematical Methods** : Laplace transforms, Fourier transforms,
    Greens functions, and their applications to partial differential
    equations.
-   **Quantum Mechanics**: Again. For the heck of it.
-   **Numerical Methods**: Analysis of the performance, stability and
    error propagation of numerical algorithms in finite precision
    systems.

So far, it's way more fun than last quarter. Still, I'm disappointed
that the molecular structures course I wanted to take conflicts with
numerical methods. Hopefully I can take it next quarter.

The preliminary exam for mathematical methods is in the middle of finals
week at the end of this quarter. That is going to suck.
