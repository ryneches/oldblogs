Summary: 


On one hand, I'm very glad to live in the district that is sending Henry
Waxman back to Congress, but on the other hand, I almost wish I lived in
one of the districts where things are close.

As it is, I get throw another protest vote against the Terminator, vote
against *yet another* stupid parental notification anti-abortion
initiative, and give a thumbs up (along with pretty much everyone else)
to Waxman. The only item we get to vote on here that will make much
difference is Prop 87, which will probably pass in my district. All the
real action is happening elsewhere.

My polling place is at the neighborhood Good Will center. They had an
optical scanner sitting on top of the ballot box. You drop your ballot
into the machine, and it shows you what you voted for. If there is
anything wrong with the ballot, or if you cancel it, it spits out and
gives you a ticket for a fresh ballot. When you approve your vote, it
drops into the ballot box and gives you two receipts -- one tells you
what you voted for, and the other has the serial number on your ballot.
I suppose in theory, if there were a recount, you could show up with
your receipt and demand to know that your particular ballot was counted.
