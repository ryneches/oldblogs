Summary: 


A lot of people fought long and hard to give me the right to a secret
ballot. This time around, though, I'm happy to show it to anyone who
cares to look.

I like this ballot system much better than the InkaVote thing they have
in LA, and *much* better than any kind of computerized bullshit. I spent
four years using computers to design fusion reactors, but I sure as hell
don't trust them with an election. Pen and paper, thanks.
