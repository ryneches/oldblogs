Summary: 


While driving up to San Francisco with Mimi, I seem to have contracted
some sort of food poisoning (E. coli, probably) at a Wendy's on the 101.

I've never liked fast food; it doesn't taste good, it's unhealthy, the
vegetarian selection sucks, and the places are loud, tacky and
uncomfortable. The food and sauces have so much salt that instead of
feeling full, I end up feeling like a beached whale bloating in the sun,
and still hungry.

Now I have one more reason to hate them. They buy produce farmed and
prepared so inexpertly that they can't keep keep the shit off of it.
I've worked on a farm myself, and I find it *astonishing* that in 2007,
we have problems like this. Running a farm is difficult, complicated
work, but making sure the food is safe to eat is one of the easiest
parts of the job. It involves very simple and inexpensive decisions like
making sure not to pour liquid pig shit on the ground directly uphill
from the where you grow the onions.

Aren't you glad that George Bush has gutted the USDA? Don't worry.
Industry can inspect itself.
