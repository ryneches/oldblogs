Summary: 


Time to cash in those frequent flier points. I'm going to places foreign
this summer, in the following order:

-   Amsterdam (for 17 hours)
-   Rome (a week and change)
-   Oxford (for the [Culham Plasma Physics Summer
    School](http://www.fusion.org.uk/info/sschool.htm))
-   London for five days
-   Berlin for four days
-   Back to London for four days

This will be great fun. If it doesn't kill me.
