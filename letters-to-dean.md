Summary: 


"I've been a proud barer of a Democracy Bond from the moment they became
available. I've given what I can to the party and to candidates I think
are worth supporting.

"For this reason, it has disturbed and saddened me that there appears to
be a nasty dust-up between Howard Dean and a number of gay organizations
and individuals. Dean's comments on the Christian Broadcasting Network
disavowing support for the civil rights of gay Americans are a betrayal
of our core values as a party. We are the party for Everyone, and that
includes gay folks.

"The Democratic Party has enough trouble defining its message as it is.
The one thing is *has* been clear about is that it stands up for folks
who are otherwise very vulnerable.

"If Dean wants a message to give to Christians, how about this: 'The
Democratic Party isn't afraid to stand up for the weak, no matter who
they are. Christ's compassion encompasses all people, and we endeavor to
emulate that.'

"Please, for the sake of our party, make peace with gay activists. For
the good of the party, gay activists may need to make themselves
somewhat less visible, but this pressure should be applied quietly,
respectfully, and in private.

"I am neither gay nor a gay activist, but these folks are part of our
movement. It is important for the Democratic Party to embrace gay
rights, as long as it is clear that gay people are *AMONG* the *MANY*
vulnerable groups we protect."
