Summary: 


Like most people who don't like totalitarianism, I'm not a big fan of
the Syrian government. From what I understand, they are not nice people.
However, their supposed odiousness is not a good reason to refuse to
talk to them. On the contrary. Otto von Bismark described politics as
"the art of the possible." Diplomacy is just politics across borders. To
refuse to engage in diplomacy is to curtail what is possible. The
administration's policy of minimal contact with "bad" governments is
guaranteed to accomplish minimal results.

On an emotional level, I can sympathize with Bush's policy toward Syria.
I'd like to personally avoid talking to the Syrian government, if at all
possible. But *someone* has to talk to them. The Syrians may have
important influence in a situation in which America is deeply involved.
I, and 300 million other Americans, pay Mr. Bush to talk to Syria so we
don't have to.

So, if Speaker Pelosi wants to roll up her sleeves and do some of the
necessary diplomatic work the administration refuses to do, I'm
perfectly happy to let her. Of course, as a member of Congress, she
can't hold binding negotiations with the Syrians, but she can have a
dialog. That's better than nothing.

Naturally, the administration is positively wigging out. The most
serious accusation is that Pelosi is "undermining" the administration's
foreign policy. In a general political sense, I suppose that might be
bad. It would certainly strengthen the administration's foreign policy
position if the Speaker of the House supported it. If the policy were
any good, support from Congress would make it better. But in this case,
the administration's foreign policy has been an unmitigated failure. I
hope, for the sake of the nation and the world, that Pelosi *is*
undermining it.

In any event, there is nothing that compels a citizen, or a member of
Congress, to uphold a particular foreign policy. That's the difference
between policy and law. George Bush cannot order me to help him with his
foreign policy, nor can he so order Speaker Pelosi. Since neither I nor
Speaker Pelosi are part of the executive chain of command, we can act
within the limits of the law to support or undermine executive policy as
it pleases us. Period.

However, I don't think Pelosi's talks with the Syrians have done
anything to undermine Bush's foreign policy. Unless, of course, George
Bush's foreign policy is simply to aggrandize himself. If that is the
policy, then maybe Pelosi has undermined it a bit.
