Summary: 


So, back in 2008, I [ported Vort.org fro Rails to
Django](http://vort.org/2008/03/27/vortorg-now-running-django/). It was
about one evening of hacking, and since then I haven't touched the code,
nor have I upgraded to Django 1.0. All I've done is patch security
holes. Since then, a whole new comment framework was introduced, the one
I'm using has been obsoleted, and a whole bunch of other changes have
happened.

I've been much too busy to maintain or upgrade the code, and it wasn't
very good to begin with. So, I'd like to hire someone who actually has
some professional experience with Django to institute a do-over. I can
handle importing all my articles and comments myself, even if the DB
model is a little different. If you can do some nice graphic design,
I'll happily pay extra for that.

As it happens, our lab is looking to [hire a full-time web
developer](http://www.employment.ucdavis.edu/applicants/Central?quickFind=57646)
for a very awesome new project. If I'm impressed with the way you handle
this simple little project, you can consider it a job interview for the
full time position in our lab. And honestly, how often do you get paid
for a job interview?

Email me your resume and a portfolio if you are interested.
