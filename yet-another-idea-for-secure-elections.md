Summary: 


Enthusiasm for schemes with which to conduct an anonymous, fraud-proof
elections once again seems to have waxed. So, here is my humble
offering.

-   Three months before the election, set up 150 vote counting centers,
    three in each state. Each center must be capable of processing the
    entire national election by itself. This is to protect against large
    numbers of centers being shut down, and to make sure the counting
    happens quickly.
-   Allow anyone to come to the vote counting center and inspect the
    equipment, interview the personnel, and test the machines.
-   As long as the vote counting center is open, there must be nearby
    courts reserved specifically for hearing complaints about the vote
    counting procedure.
-   In the months before the election, distribute a few rounds of test
    ballots with imaginary candidates. Anyone may submit a test ballot
    and see that their vote was counted.
-   The week before the election, official ballot kits are printed at
    the vote counting centers. All aspects of the printing process are
    open to the public. Anyone may cull a ballot kit from the print
    process for inspection. All culled ballots must be immediately and
    publicly destroyed once inspected. Each ballot kit contains a local
    voter guide (like California's Voter Information Guide), a ballot
    sheet, three envelopes, and a special card marked with the serial
    number matching the ballot sheet. The card must be printed on
    something that can be easily and utterly destroyed by the voter. For
    example, paper that quickly dissolves in water. Each ballot kit is
    sealed in an air tight pouch with a tamper detection card; once the
    detector is exposed to air or light, it changes color and clearly
    indicates a spoiled ballot kit.
-   At this point, if there are unaddressed problems at a vote counting
    center, it will be shut down and the ballot kits printed there
    destroyed. The courts will be instructed to accept nothing short of
    perfect working order.
-   One week is set aside for voting. Everyone gets at least one paid
    vacation day and one half day.
-   On the first day of the election week, distribute ballot kits to
    their respective localities. Ballots for different localities can be
    requested by people who will be away from home. Ballots are also
    sent to all U.S. embassies and consular offices for citizens
    traveling or living abroad.
-   During the election week, local post offices will remain open
    extended hours.
-   Everyone marks their ballot sheets. Each one has three carbon
    copies. Each copy goes into one of the envelopes. To submit a
    ballot, the voter goes to the post office and presents their ID.
    Their voter registration number is logged in a central database so
    that they cannot submit more than three ballots.
-   The voter may then send the ballot to *any* vote counting center.
-   Voters may drop off the envelopes at different post offices, or on
    different days. If they like, they can also drop off their ballots
    directly at the voting centers.
-   At the end of each day during the week, the USPS suspends normal
    operations and processes ONLY ballot deliveries. USPS vehicles are
    escorted by police to the vote counting centers, but anyone is
    allowed to follow and videotape the delivery.
-   When the election week is over, the ballot envelopes are opened and
    the ballots scanned. All aspects of this process are open to the
    public.
-   When a ballot is scanned, its serial number and vote tallies are
    logged. When all votes are counted, the complete logs are published
    on the Internet in files of large groups of sequential serial
    numbers. To find your vote, you retrieve the range of votes that
    contains your serial number.
-   Redundant ballots are logged but not added to the count.
-   The final result of the election can be tabulated by anyone with
    some hard drive space and a simple program.

I think that would probably address most of the really bad problems with
our elections. I like the idea of sitting down on a vacation day with my
ballot, reading the information guide for a while, maybe checking stuff
online if I'm curious, and then dropping it off when I'm done. It could
be sort of like Thanksgiving, but with an actual serious purpose.

With a week's time instead of a single workday, there would actually be
time to address problems that come up. If you go to vote and discover
that you aren't registered, you get it fixed (even if it takes a day or
two). If someone distributes misleading campaign information, there is
time to alert people. The most important thing, though, is that it would
make it possible for ordinary people to help verify the integrity of the
system in a meaningful way.

It would still be possible to steal an election, but it would be hugely
difficult to do without getting noticed. Even if one were able to
subvert several of the voting centers, it would still leave very obvious
statistical fingerprints. In each subverted counting center, there would
be no way to know where the other two copies of a particular vote went
until after the count is complete. Stealing a vote would require
subverting at least three counting centers and isolating only the votes
whose ballots happened to be sent to those particular centers. This
would have to be done during the counting process while people are
watching. To defeat a large-scale attack, all that is needed is to
detect or thwart this exchange of information. Any other sort of attack
would require getting at ballots before they are delivered. Ordinary
people could make that very difficult just by following the ballot
boxes.

In any event, the result isn't actually calculated by the center; it can
be calculated by anyone. This makes it impossible to hide stolen votes
in the aggregate numbers. If votes were stolen, the people who cast
those votes would know. And in any event, the paper ballot sheets
themselves would still exist. The fact that each vote would be shuffled
across the country in a different way would require an attacker to
destroy every one of the ballot archives to conceal the fraud. So, of
course, one could simply say that the election results are valid only as
long as its archives physically exist. If the archives are destroyed, a
new election must be held immediately.
