Summary: 


I guess it's more or less official now, so in the grand tradition of the
inter-tubes, it requires a blog announcement. I've moved out of my
apartment near UCLA, so I'm not essentially homeless. I'll be shuttling
around between Pasadena, UCLA and Cypress for the foreseeable future.

I suppose that means I'll be inhabiting the guest house behind my mom's
house, but right now the situation has more to do with storage than
inhabitation.

Now I get to find out how much of my security deposit my landlord will
return.
