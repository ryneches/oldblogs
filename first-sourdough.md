Summary: 


My first attempt at sourdough bread seems to have produced a pair of
unexpectedly tasty results. I was rather skeptical that this would
actually work the first time. The taste came out much better than I had
hoped for; awesome sourness, but not so sour as to overpower the flavor
of the wheat. These are 50% whole grain, so they have some nice texture
from the bran, but are still chewy and moist.

The boules didn't quite shape up the way I wanted them to, and sort of
spread out on the baking pan once they came out of the bannetons. That's
why they're more disk-shaped than sphere-shaped. Also, I didn't attempt
anything fancy with the crust.

I cultured the starter from stone milled rye flour, and fed it
alternating whole wheat and white flour every 12 hours for two weeks.
The starter was the only difficult part. I killed my first starter by
accidentally overheating it in my makeshift incubation pan. I gave up on
the precise temperature control, which seems to have produced a somewhat
less lively starter. It lifts the dough just fine, though.

The ingredients were :

-   1/4 cup starter
-   3 cup whole wheat flour
-   3 1/2 cups white bread flour
-   2 1/2 cups water
-   2 tsp salt

I know it's better to use grams than cups for measuring flour, but I
don't have a good bench scale yet.

This made two loafs, which I put into bannetons for 12 hours of rising.
I baked them for 45 minutes at 375F, with a pan of water bubbling away
at the bottom of the oven.

I made the bannetons from some small fruit baskets that were sitting
around attracting junk accumulation. I made the liners by reclaiming
some nice raw linen that was part of an IKEA laundry basket that had
fallen apart at the seams (carefully washed, of course). I floured the
banneton liners carefully, so they didn't stick much at all.
