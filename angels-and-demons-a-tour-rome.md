Summary: 


I haven't read the book, but Mimi has, and thought it would be fun to do
[a tour of Rome based on Dan Brown's
book](http://www.angelsanddemons.it/). It was actually an extremely cool
tour. If you want a quick plot summary, the [Wikipedia page is pretty
good](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angels_and_Demons). When I first
picked up the book, I couldn't get past the first page -- the bit about
the antimatter bomb just made me giggle. Now that I've seen the place
the book is about, I might give it a second shot.

We went on Sunday, so the churches we visited were having services. We
visited :

### Santa Maria del Popolo Church (Piazza del Popolo)

### St. Peter's square

Of course everyone knows St. Peter's Basilica. Notice that Bernini
designed the piazza as a Keplerian ellipse, which was a not-so-subtle
dig at Church dogma. At each focus of the ellipse, the columns line up,
allowing you to see out of the square.

### Santa Maria della Vittoria Church (Largo di Santa Susanna)

### Pantheon

The Pantheon was built more than two thousand years ago to be the
personal temple of the Roman emperor. It really does defy description.

### Piazza della Minerva

This is the church where Gallileo was tried, and where he was later
forced to recant his discoveries.

### Piazza Navona

### Castel Sant'Angelo and "il Passetto"

I've posted [a new gallery]() of the photos that came out reasonably
well.
