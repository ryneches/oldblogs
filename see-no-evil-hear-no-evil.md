Summary: 


For various reasons, a lot of people remain very skeptical about global
warming. The most often cited (sane) reason for maintaining this
skepticism is that the data has been patched together from many
different sources, and that no single source of evidence conclusively
demonstrates that global warming is occurring. With such a complicated
argument, perhaps there are alternative explanations, one might wonder.

![](http://vort.org/media/images/dscovr.jpg) The important thing about
global warming is that it is a theory, and thus it is falsifiable. If
there are doubts about the validity of this theory, we can design an
experiment that would reliably falsify the theory if it were, in fact,
wrong. NASA has designed and built such an experiment, called Deep Space
Climate Observatory (DSCOVR). It would sit at the L1 Lagrange point
between the Earth and the Sun, where it can continuously observe the
Earth's daylight side. From this vantage, it would calculate an
accurate, up-to-the-minute energy budget for the whole planet. It would
also collect detailed measurements of the atmospheric and surface
composition of our planet.

If anthropic global warming is a bad theory, then DSCOVR would shoot it
down in a hurry. On the other hand, if the theory is correct, as most
climate scientists have concluded already, DSCOVR would provide us with
simple, conclusive evidence gathered with uniform methodology.

But the global warming skeptics, or at least the ones in Congress, have
never been interested in actually falsifying the theory. [They were much
happier wallowing in
ignorance.](http://seedmagazine.com/news/2006/09/free_dscovr.php%0A)

*Science* ran a letter from Francisco P. J. Valero titled [Keeping the
DSCOVR Mission
Alive](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/long/311/5762/775c). I will
quote the relevant part since most people don't have access to articles
in *Science* :

> request to satisfy scientific needs and NOAA's operational
> requirements for space weather monitoring. DSCOVR is firmly based on

> mission but was by no means the primary objective.

France and the Ukraine have offered to launch it for us, but NASA has
rebuffed their offers.

Next time you find yourself arguing with someone about global warming,
tell them that the experiment to prove or disprove it, once and for all,
was canned by Congress when the Republicans were running it. By their
own admission, they canned it because they wanted to humiliate Al Gore.
All we have to do is launch the damn thing, instead of letting it sit in
a box at Goddard Space Flight Center at the cost of a million dollars a
year.
