Summary: 


Dear Mr. Gore,

Even if you don't run, we can still [draft you](http://draftgore.com/).
Please don't take offense.

Thank you.

Al Gore in GQ :

> **So if you decide to run, do you think we would see the Al Gore from
> the movie? Or the Al Gore from 2000?** \
>  Well, I don't plan to run. I don't plan to run. And I don't expect to
> run.
>
> **How many times a day does somebody ask you this?** \
>  Well, I'm doing a lot of interviews and it's on the list of
> questions. For every one of them. And I appreciate that. I appreciate
> that people think enough of me still in that world to ask that
> question. It's true that I haven't, uh, gotten to the point where I am
> willing to completely rule it out for all time. But, that is really
> more a matter of the internal shifting of gears. I'm not making plans
> to run again.

> **But you're not ruling it out?** \
>  Uh... no. [smiles]

Dear everyone else,

To help draft Mr. Gore, you can donate to his campaign (whether he wants
one or not) at his [Act Blue Presidential Draft
page](http://www.actblue.com/entity/fundraisers/12507). Your donations
will go to the DNC if Mr. Gore doesn't enter the race by the national
convention.
