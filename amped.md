Summary: 


I just finished debugging and assembling my very first audio amplifier.
It's a thumping 2.5 Watts of single-channel sound. I built it around the
mighty [LM380 2.5W Audio Power
Amplifier](http://www.national.com/pf/LM/LM380.html). I also have a
preamplifier stage, which turns out to be rather unnecessary for
stepping up the line input from (for example) my iPod.

It's powered by a 9-Volt battery that I've squashed inside. Not quite
audiophile material, but I want to build a real audiophile-quality
amplifier someday, and I figured I ought to start somewhere.
