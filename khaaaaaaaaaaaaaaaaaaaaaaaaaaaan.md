Summary: 


The Mongolian embassy is looking into the possibility of [placing a
statue of Genghis
Khan](http://www.examiner.com/a-322586~Growing_Mongolian_community_seeks_Genghis_Khan_statue_in_D_C_.html)
on city land in Washington D.C. in the hopes that it would it would help
Mongolians and Americans get to know one another.

I hope they get to build it. I hope that they put the statue at
street-level, and he will be riding a foaming-at-the-mouth galloping war
horse, drawing a bow with the arrow angled such that it scares the shit
out of people as they walk around the corner, because that would be
awesome. Sadly, it is hoped that the statue will help remind people that
the whole conquest of the known world shtick wasn't the only thing
noteworthy about Genghis Khan. After all, Alexander the Great did the
same thing.

Really, I suppose it is a little surprising that embassies everywhere
don't have a little shrine to Genghis Khan. As the inventor of
diplomatic immunity, he saves them millions of dollars on parking
tickets every year.
