Summary: 


Back in May 2007, I decided I'd try writing a Wikipedia article. I can't
remember why I was seized by the impulse. I think I was supposed to be
studying for something, and I'd already cleaned the bathroom and
organized my closet. I pondered for a some time on the problem of
selecting a topic obscure enough not to have a page already, and yet not
so obscure as to become a target for the dreaded Deletionist clan of
Wikipedians.

And lo, the [Tasty Bite page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasty_Bite)
was born. Looking at the page traffic, I fear that it will eventually
become my [most widely read piece of
writing](http://stats.grok.se/en/200912/Tasty_Bite).

Well, they are pretty tasty. Oh, and those very mediocre pictures? I
took those myself, and then consumed the contents of the pouch. Also, my
friend Srijak says there is no such thing as "Bombay Potatoes," but he
eats them too.
