Summary: 


It seems like [everyone's writing to
Disney/ABC](http://www.housedemocrats.gov/news/librarydetail.cfm?library_content_id=876)
to complain about their little foray into propaganda. I doubt that *The
Path to 9/11* will have the same power to move people as [*Triumph of
the Will*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumph_of_the_will), but it
belongs on the same shelf.

> Dear Mr. Iger,
>
> It has come to my attention that ABC intends to air a program called
> "The Path to 9/11" on September 10 and September 11. I am writing to
> bring to your attention that the piece was written and directed by a
> Republican campaign official. The dramatization contains depictions of
> the events that are directly contradicted by the evidence gathered by
> the 9/11 Commission. This is not a documentary, but rather a
> Republican public relations infomercial.
>
> The piece would be an outrage if it were not immediately recognizable
> as an extended political ad. Like so much of campaign material today,
> the piece is laden with inaccuracies and personal smears.
>
> Many people would ask you to correct the "balance" of the piece by
> correcting the factual errors it contains. I am not of this view. If
> the Republican party wishes to use dishonest portrayals of events in
> its campaigns, it is welcome to do so.
>
> I do not believe that it is your responsibility to provide a balanced
> view. To your viewers, you have a responsibility to tell the truth. To
> your investors, you have a responsibility to turn a profit. The
> responsible thing, in both senses, is not to air "The Path to 9/11."
> It is easily shown to be untruthful, and a majority of Americans will
> likely find it deeply offensive.
>
> The Republican Party has plenty of money to pay for ads, and yet this
> program has been constructed as an elaborate campaign advertisement.
> You owe it to your investors, and to the public, to see that the
> Republican Party pays for its ads just like everyone else.
