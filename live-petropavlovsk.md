 *Singlehandedly bringing [PLoS](http://plos.org) to new frontiers!*

I arrived safely in Petropavlovsk yesterday after a very long layover in
Khabarovsk and an even longer layover in Vladivostok. Frank Robb and
Alex Merkel met me at the gate, and we wobbled off with [our
driver](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rneches/4848121382/) to the
[Volcanology
Institute](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rneches/4847494963/) to file my
paperwork.

 *Beer! Where have you been all this time?*

After dropping my stuff off at the apartment, Frank took everyone out
for pizza. Airport and airline food in Russia leaves a bit to be
desired, especially if you are vegetarian and don't speak Russian.
Pretty much everything is covered in, stuffed with, or made entirely out
of sausages.

I basically hadn't had anything to eat in 24 hours, so I was *extremely
glad* to get my hands on the pizza (I ate almost two). The beer was also
extremely welcome.

 *Fog, cursed fog.*

Unfortunately, Petropavlovsk is fogged in with what everyone keeps
caling a "cyclone," but I don't think the word is used in the same sense
as I'm used to. It seems to be a huge fog bank with drizzle coming in
from the ocean. The helicopters we will fly to Uzon Caldera are
fly-by-sight, so we're grounded in Petropavlovsk until the weather
clears.

For now, it's seven scientists crammed into a tiny one-bedroom Soviet
era apartment with a dozen laptops, piles of camping gear, and two whole
laboratories (one for geochemistry, one for recombinant DNA) stuffed
into freight boxes. Time to go exploring...
