Summary: 


From somewhere above the Mongolia/Siberia frontier.

I suppose it is somewhat fitting that, on my way to visit the planet's
newly crowned Number One Emitter of carbon dioxide, I should get a
fantastic view of the patch of the planet that all this carbon dioxide
is having the most dangerous effect. I visited Greenland in 1993, so
it's interesting to see what it looks like 15 years later. Normally I
think out-the-window shots are pretty crummy, but I think these make up
for their poor image quality and composition by being pretty damn
interesting.

This is the ice pack on the Davis Straight, between the west coast of
Greenland and Canada. As you can see, there really isn't any pack ice.
In August of 1993, we had planned to sail across the straight to visit
the Baffin Island. We had abandon those plans because the pack ice was
too heavy to navigate, even for our specially equipped vessel. We had to
hug the coast of Greenland, following shipping lanes kept clear with ice
breakers.

This is the west coastline of Disco Island. In 1993, it was kind of
impossible to tell where the pack ice ended and the island started. Now,
it's pretty obvious. After we visited Disco Island, we spent a few rough
days hammering our into Baffin Bay. The noise of the ice crashing
against the hull was awful. Imagine being trapped in a garbage can while
someone beats it with a chandelier. We gave up and turned around after a
few days of it.

This is Disco Bay. In 1993, I remember standing on the Greenland side.
The pack ice on the bay had ruptured, but it was very thick and clogged
with icebergs. The noise of the ice grinding and grumbling on the chop
was so loud that it was impossible to have a conversation without
shouting. Now, it looks like the Charles River in Boston around
springtime.

Here is a glacier on Disco Island, just 'cause it's awesome.
