Summary: 


Just in case you didn't have enough reasons to hate smog, researchers at
UCLA's David Geffen School of Medicine have [announced the
results](http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-me-heart26jul26,0,2928424.story?coll=la-home-center)
of a study concluding that exposure to diesel and coal exhaust causes
heart disease. Many people live for years with elevated cholesterol
without developing heart disease, and many people live with smog without
developing heart disease. However, it appears that the combination of
elevated cholesterol and exposure to fine particles from hydrocarbon
combustion activate the genes that lead to the hardening of arteries.

So, if you live in the city, then you *really* need to listen to your
doctor if she tells you to lower your LDL/HDL levels.

Anyway, I suppose PG&E is [moving in the right
direction](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3430085,00.html) by
building the world's largest solar plant in Southern California -- a
6000 acre, half-gigawatt solar thermal plant in the Mojave desert. PG&E
has contracted [Solel](http://www.solel.com/), and Israeli company
specializing in solar energy, to build the plant. There are already nine
solar thermal plants operating in the Mojave desert, totaling 354
megawatts in capacity. When the new plant comes online, Mojave will have
nearly a gigawatt of solar thermal generating capacity.

[According to LADWP](http://www.ladwp.com/ladwp/cms/ladwp000509.jsp),
the city's peak demand is 5.7 gigawatts, and a little more than half of
that demand, or about 2.97 gigawatts, is met by burning coal. Assuming
LADWP substitutes the new solar thermal capacity for coal capacity,
LADWP could reduce its utilization of coal generating capacity, and thus
emissions from coal, by about 18%. That's a significant chunk, but not
nearly good enough.
