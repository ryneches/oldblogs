Summary: 


This morning my dad sent me a New York Times op-ed by Dan Ariely, a
professor of behavioral economics at Duke, on the total idiocy that is
executive bonus pay. Here's the main bit :

My dad asked, "Surprised?"

Nope. Not surprised at all.

The whole theory of executive pay is based on a slightly different idea
than motivation. Boards are not exactly trying to motivate their
executives to perform, they are trying to attract what are invariably
described as "the highest caliber" candidates. It works if you assume
that ability is some kind intrinsic property of humans, and that if you
dangle a big reward in front of a big group of people, the most able
ones will triumph and seize the prize. It's naked social Darwinism.
That's what people *mean* when they talk about people's "caliber," or
whatever. It's sloppy thinking, and sloppy thinking usually gets the
sloppy thinker into trouble. A gigantic, world-girding economic
catastrophe, for example.

I think bonuses fail for an even simpler reason than Dr. Ariely
suggests: In a strictly scientific sense, there is no such thing as a
smart person. There is no way to rank human beings based on cognitive
skill in any meaningful way. In fact, it's not even clear we can define
"cognitive skill." It's a 19th century idea that has been so thoroughly
debunked that it has become a kind of parlor game for psychologists.

There are a lot of reasons for this, but chief among them is that we do
not, in any substantive way, understand the nature of intelligence. We
may think we know it when we see it, but we have no way of measuring it.

Tests of intelligence are actually on worse scientific footing than
those people you see on TLC videotaping empty hallways through
osmium-doped filters in the effort to prove the existence of ghosts. At
least the ghost hunters are usually honest about their total lack of
evidence, and at least there is some reasonable expectation that if
there *were* ghosts, that you would would see them on the tapes. The
College Board, and ETS, and pretty much every professor engaged in
teaching that I've ever spoken with lack even the intellectual honesty
of crackpot ghost hunters.

Clearly, there is variation among people when it comes to performance of
specific tasks. Some people are really good at memorizing sequences of
numbers and repeating them back in some carefully jumbled order. This is
usually taken as an indicator of mathematical ability. Nevertheless, I
find that I cannot memorize sequences of numbers to save my life, but
that doesn't stop me from doing quantum mechanics.

So, once we've measured everyone's performance on the
regurgitating-numbers-test, and put everything in a big table and sorted
the table by score, what have we learned? Well, not very much. We might
be able to draw some conclusions about people in general, perhaps, by
correlating performance on the test with choice of breakfast cereal, or
whatever. But it doesn't tell you anything of significance about an
individual test subject.

However, it is usually possible to tell a smart *idea* from a dumb one.
Unlike people, ideas can be subjected to detailed analysis. They can be
examined for internal logical correctness. They can be modeled by
equations, or simulated, or tested empirically, or compared to
historical data for similar situations and the results considered. They
can be slotted into a multiplying zoology of ready-made intellectual
frameworks, and poked and prodded and stretched and tortured in all
sorts of interesting ways. They can be placed head-to-head with other
ideas in the analysis gauntlet, and in many cases it is possible to pick
winners, or at least to triage pretty good ideas from dumb ones.

It's more work to pick smart ideas ideas than to pick smart people
because the techniques we have for picking smart people are a fraudulent
mummery that can be conducted with hardly any work at all. And lo, we
see that systems in which ideas compete work very well (e.g., science),
and systems in which people compete are either totally artificial (e.g.,
sports) or tend to function worse than had you picked the players at
random (e.g., business, politics).

If you dangle a big reward in front of a big group of people, all you
really know about the person who seizes the reward is that you have
found someone who is good at taking large amounts of money from people.
If I were looking for someone to run my company, I would be suspicious
of such a person.
