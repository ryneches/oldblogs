Summary: 


On Friday morning, a fellow named Boris and two of his friends got on
their bicycles for a ride. As they pedaled along, observing the speed
limit and traffic rules, a speeding truck overtook them. As it bounced
over a speed bump, it's rear door swung open and snagged a parked car,
and flung it across the road. It came within a few inches of crushing
Boris and his friends.

So far, the event I've described above seems fairly unremarkable. Things
like that happen all the time. There are two unusual things about this
crash, though. First of all, the incident was caught on tape by a
security camera, so we know exactly what happened. The three
near-victims were Lord Adonis, Kulveer Ranger, and Boris Johnson; [the
UK's minister of transport, the director of transport of the city of
London, and the mayor of
London](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/may/23/boris-cycling),
respectively.

The three were cycling through London to scope out possible routes for a
system of protected bicycle "super-highways." Mr. Johnson had the
following to say about the incident:

> "I am relieved that no-one was hurt, but this incident reinforces the
> need for us to make London's roads safer for cyclists, which I am
> determined to do and to make London the best city for cyclists in
> Europe.
> <p>
> "Cycle Super Highways, which are part of our record investment in
> cycling, will play a central role in this, providing clearly
> demarcated routes for cyclists that lorry drivers and others will be
> aware of."

What does this mean for American cities? I would take three lessons.
First, London is huge, cramped, and damp. Yet London is looking to
bicycles as a significant part of its transportation mix, and the city
government takes it seriously enough that the mayor himself is regularly
out surveying bicycle routes. Bicycles are a serious metropolitan
transportation system, not just a recreational activity. Relative to
London, cities like Davis are in a much stronger position when it comes
to cycling; it should press its advantage.

Second, helmet laws and cycling safety initiatives are important, but
even the most careful cyclist -- *even the mayor of London* -- can do
very little to protect himself from a rampaging truck.

Third, out-of-control vehicles are depressingly common. If you want
bicycles to play a serious role in municipal transportation, you *must*
deal with vehicle safety.

As if vehicle safety weren't worth pursuing anyway! 43,000 Americans die
every year in car accidents. That's like one 9/11 hijacking every month.
Bringing this number down will take more than airbags and antilock
breaks. It will require making some changes in the way we drive, and the
roads we drive on.
