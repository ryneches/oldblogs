Summary: 


After six months of using [Google
Latitude](http://www.google.com/latitude/apps), I've amassed about 7108
location updates, or about 38 a day. It would probably be a lot more if
I hadn't managed on occasion to break the GPS or automatic updating by
fiddling with the software.

It's actually quite useful to have this data, especially if it's
correlated with some richer information. For example, I've consulted the
data to answer questions like, "Where was that awesome sandwich place I
ate at last month?" It's also extremely useful to be able to share this
data with Google because it allows me to quickly cross-reference
location coordinates with Google's database of businesses and addresses.
You can also download your complete location history in one giant blob
(just ignore the warning that the [History
map](https://www.google.com/latitude/apps/history/) only displays 500
datapoints, and download the KML file). Once you have the KML file, you
can do whatever you want with it. For example, I uploaded mine to
[Indiemapper](http://indiemapper.com/) to map my wanderings for the last
six months (Indiemapper is cool, but I quickly found that this dataset
is really much too big for a Flash-based web application).

Not surprisingly, I spent most of my time in California, mostly in Davis
and the Bay Area, with a few trips to Los Angeles via I-5, the [Coast
Starlight](http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer/AM_Route_C/1241245648567/1237405732511),
and the [San
Joaquin](http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer/AM_Route_C/1241245650084/1237405732511)
(the density of points along those routes is indicative of the data
service along the way).

The national map shows my trip to visit my dad's family in New Jersey
and Massachusetts, as well as a layover in Denver that I'd completely
forgotten about.

I have somewhat mixed feelings about this dataset. On one hand, it's
very useful to have, and sharing it with my friends and with Google is
very useful. It's also cool to have this sort of quantitative insight
into my recent past so easily accessible. On the other hand, I'm not
particularly happy with the idea that Google controls this data. I chose
the word *controls* deliberately. I don't mind that they *have* the data
-- after all, I did give it to them. As far as I know, Google has been a
good citizen when it comes to keeping personal location data
confidential. The Latitude documentation makes their policy pretty clear
:

> ### Privacy

> Google Location History is an opt-in feature that you must explicitly
> enable for the Google Account you use with Google Latitude. Until you
> opt in to Location History, no Latitude location history beyond your
> most recently updated location if you aren't hiding is stored for your
> account. Your location history can only be viewed when you're signed
> in to your Google Account.
>
> You may delete your location history by individual location, date
> range, or entire history. Keep in mind that disabling Location History

> <p>
> No. When you delete any part of your location history, it is deleted

> recover your deleted location history.

So, that's what they'll do with it, and I'm happy with that. What
bothers me is this: *Who owns this data?*

This question leads directly to one of the most scorchingly
controversial questions you could ask for, and there are profound legal,
social, economic and moral outcomes riding on how we answer it. This
isn't just about figuring out what coffee shops I like. If you want to
see how high the stakes go, buy one of
[23andMe's](https://www.23andme.com/) DNA tests. You're giving them
access to perhaps the most personal dataset imaginable. In fairness,
23andMe has a very strong confidentiality policy.

But therein lays the problem -- it's a *policy*. Ambiguous or fungible
confidentiality policies are at the heart of an increasing number of
lawsuits and public snarls. For example, there is the case of the blood
samples taken from the Havasupai Indians for use in diabetes research
that turned up in research on schizophrenia. The tribe felt insulted and
misled, and sued Arizona State University (the case was [recently
settled](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/weekinreview/25harmon.html),
the tribe prevailing on practically every item).

You can't mention informed consent and not revisit HeLa, the first
immortal human cells known to science. HeLa was cultured from a tissue
biopsy from [Henrietta Lacks](http://www.henriettalacksfoundation.org/)
and shared among thousands of researchers -- even [sold as a commercial
product](https://www.atcc.org/ATCCAdvancedCatalogSearch/ProductDetails/tabid/452/Default.aspx)
-- making her and her family one of the most studied humans in medical
history. The biopsy, the culturing, the sharing and the research all
happened without her knowledge or consent, or the knowledge or consent
of her family.

And, of course, there is Facebook -- again. Their new "Instant
Personalization" feature amounts to sharing information about personal
relationships and cultural tastes with commercial partners on an [op-out
basis](http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/04/how-opt-out-facebook-s-instant-personalization%0A).
Unsurprisingly,
[people](http://sanfrancisco.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2010/04/26/daily29.html)
[are](http://www.examiner.com/x-33328-Technology-Examiner~y2010m4d23-Facebook-releases-Instant-Personalization-and-people-are-upset)
[pissed](http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/how-to-opt-out-of-facebooks-instant-personalization/)
[off](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_centralization.php).

Some types of data are specifically protected by statute. If you hire a
lawyer, the data you share with them is protected by attorney-client
privilege, and cannot be disclosed even by court order. Conversations
with a psychiatrist are legally confidential under all but a handful of
specifically described circumstances. Information you disclose to the
Census cannot be used for any purpose other than the Census.
Nevertheless, there are many types of data that have essentially no
statutory confidentiality requirements, and these types of data are
becoming more abundant, more detailed, and more valuable.

While I appreciate Google's promises, I'm disturbed that the only thing
protecting my data is the goodwill of a company. While a company might
be full of a lots of good people, public companies are always punished
for altruistic behavior sooner or later. There is always a constituency
of assholes among shareholders who believe that the only profitable
company is a mean company, an they'll sue to get their way. Managers
must be very mindful of this fact as they navigate the ever changing
markets, and so altruistic behavior in a public company can never be
relied upon.

We cannot rely on thoughtful policies, ethical researchers or altruistic
companies to keep our data under our control. The data we generate in
the course of our daily lives is too valuable, and the incentives for
abuse are overwhelming. I believe we should go back to the original
question -- *who owns this data?* -- and answer it. The only justifiable
answer is that the person described by the data owns the data, and may
dictate the terms under which the data may be used.

People who want the data -- advertisers, researchers, statisticians,
public servants -- fear that relinquishing their claim on this data will
mean that they will lose it. I strongly disagree. I believe that people
will share more freely if they know they can change their mind, and that
the law will back them up.

### Update

The EFF put together [a very sad
timeline](http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/04/facebook-timeline/) of
Facebook's privacy policies as they've evolved from 2005 to now. They
conclude, depressingly :

> Viewed together, the successive policies tell a clear story. Facebook
> originally earned its core base of users by offering them simple and
> powerful controls over their personal information. As Facebook grew
> larger and became more important, it could have chosen to maintain or
> improve those controls. Instead, it's slowly but surely helped itself
> - and its advertising and business partners - to more and more of its
> users' information, while limiting the users' options to control their
> own information.
