Summary: 


A guy in my apartment building just fell down the stairs right in front
of my bedroom window. I put my glasses on and saw a puddle of blood
slicking the concrete walkway, about ten feet from my pillow. About half
the blood was coming out of his forehead, the other from a seep in his
shirt where his collarbone is.

I went outside to see if he was moving. He wasn't. He didn't respond
when I spoke to him. So, I did the logical thing -- I grabbed my phone
and I called 911.

*And it fucking **crashed**.* So, I tried again, and it crashed
**again**. I was in the process of ripping out the SIM card and charging
up my old phone when the Davis 911 dipatcher called back. The good news
is that the EMTs were fast. As soon as the dispatcher hung up, I stepped
out to the street to wait for them, and I could already see the lights
coming up the street.

So, listen here Google, T-Mobile and HTC: **FUCK YOU**. Fix your shit.
