Summary: 


As a Jew (or as some people might insist, someone of Jewish ancestry)
and as an American, I'd like go on record and say that Avigdor Lieberman
is a fucking piece of shit. So is his party, so his his loyalty oath,
and so is everything he stands for. And I'd like to extend a big fat
"Fuck You" to everyone who voted for him, and to everyone who signs his
loyalty oath, and to every fellow traveler throughout history.

If you don't know who he is, imagine crossbreeding Ann Coulter, George
Wallace, Sarah Palin and Joseph McCarthy, and then Bar Mitzvah the
result.
