Summary: 


Mimi and I spent the day walking around Paris. The city is very, very
different from how I remember it, though that isn't much of a surprise.
Not only is my memory of Paris warped by the fact that I was six years
old when I was here before, but it was also twenty years ago. I think
this is honestly the first time I have been able to say, "It's been
twenty years since I *bla bla bla*..." Clearly, Paris has changed a lot
since 1986 -- the most important difference being cleanliness. Paris was
positively *filthy* when I was a little kid, and I came away with a
stronger memory of the city-wide layer of grime than any of the
beautiful artwork of the Louvre. I also remember the stink of the subway
(which smelled powerfully of feet and urine) far more vividly than the
famous Paris bakeries. Today, Paris is beautiful and (mostly)
sweet-smelling.

We had a good time walking about yesterday -- we did the "Left Bank
Walk" from Rick Steves' Paris guide. We started at the Pont des Arts,
past Voltaire's garden (and smirking statue), and paused for espresso at
the famous La Palette Cafe.

Unfortunately, I still seem to be suffering from the lingering effects
of my head-cold / chest-cold / bronchitis / pneumonia / plague thing,
and I had a miserable four hours of agony as the pressure in my sinuses
reached stellar-core levels. It was a bit like having someone pound a
nail *out* of my skull from behind my right eyebrow. After four Tylenol
and many hot compresses, something in my head made a bony snapping
noise, followed by the much-anticipated squealing noise of air rushing
through a very small hole. Mimi dropped the book she was reading and
looked worried and slightly ill. Sweet, sweet relief!

We did a quick visit to Notre Dame, had lunch at the Montparnasse train
station (Mimi had to buy tickets for her students' trip tomorrow), had
coffee at the Louvre, and watched Floyd Landis win the Tour de France.

All in all, a successful day.
