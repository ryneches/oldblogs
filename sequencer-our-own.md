Summary: 


We just finished running our new GS Jr. gene sequencer for the first
time. It produced 115,698 shotgun reads of our *E. coli*. Here is the
read length histogram :

And the GC content histogram :

This was our first time going through the shotgun library protocol,
which is pretty involved. For example, we're going to have to be more
careful next time when we load the picotiter plate. We got a few bubbles
trapped in there. It's kind of funny how obvious the bubbles are in the
raw florescence images (this is an A, around cycle 200) :

I've uploaded the FASTA file and the qual file, in case you want to try
to assemble your own *E. coli* genome.
