Summary: 


Now that finals are over, I can get back to my research for a while. The
last issue that needs to be settled before I can submit my paper for
publication is the matter of The Ripples.

The ripples are an artifact of a numerical trick I had to use to make
the computation run quickly when the plasma beta is near 100%. I had to
interpolate one of the intermediate steps, rather than calculating the
exact result every time. The ripples go away when I switch off the
interpolation step -- it's just prohibitively slow.

So, this is the last hurdle. Then I can publish. Woo hoo!
