Summary: 


I'm almost done packing up for my flight back to the US. I really can't
wait to get home. It's been fun, but I'm starting to hate it. It's time
to go home.

I returned the busted suitcase today, and purchased the fine example of
1980's industrial design at a "car boot sale" (the term Britons insist
on using when they mean "rummage sale") pictured below.

It is amazingly tough, though I don't care for the little dinky wheels
at the end. It tends to tip over. However, the 14 pounds I payed for it
beats the hell out of 55 pounds for the other case.

Anyway, it's off to bed with me, for my three hours of sleep!
