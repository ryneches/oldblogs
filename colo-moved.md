Summary: 


[Kevin](http://jibsheet.com), [Billy](http://www.reshippie.net/) and
possibly [Muncus](http://nerdcircus.org/) (not sure if he got a ride or
not) moved our colo box from [Boston
Datacenters](http://www.bostondatacenters.com/) to
[Savvis](http://www.savvis.net). Evidently, everything went reasonably
smoothly, except that the racks at Savvis have round holes, and the
rails on our machine use square holes. So, the machine is sitting on the
floor of the rack until such time as rails for round-holed-racks are
procured or a rack with square holes is located.

**Update:** Evidiently Muncus had to do something with his teeth (holes
drilled, molten metal poured, drugs administered...), but Tom made it.
