Oh Engadget, [how trite art
thou](http://www.engadget.com/2010/12/23/ion-personal-genome-machine-the-dna-sequencer-with-an-ipod-dock/)?
Leave it to them to get excited about the iPod dock on a machine that
will be the least expensive and fastest DNA sequencer yet built. The
iPod dock is one of several options the Ion Torrent machine has for
attaching external mass storage. Why is it there? Because if you're
going to pay fifty grand for a sequencer, it's just good business to
spring for the two dollars worth of parts if it lets potential customers
use whatever mass storage options they have available.

Harf. Leave it to Engadget to write an article that is actually *less
interesting than the press release.*
