Summary: 


A few weeks ago, my dad sent me this really nice espresso machine to
cheer me up. Actually, he sent it to me because it was it was his

it. I've found that my burr grinder doesn't quite go fine enough for
espresso, so I'm going to have to take it apart and see if I can adjust
the grinding wheels so they're closer together. Anyway, here is my
latest effort :
