Summary: 


Lincoln Chafee, who lost to his Democratic rival, has [pledged to block
the re-nomination of John
Bolton](http://edition.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/11/10/bolton.congress/index.html).
Chafee's defeat is one of the races that I feel a little pang of regret
about. I can't say I agree with him on very many things, but I always
got the impression that Chafee is one of the reasonable Republicans. It
always seemed that going into a debate, he would actually admit the
possibility that the other side might be right. If people like him had
more influence over the Republican party, the last six years wouldn't
have been so terrible.

On the other hand, if he really had wanted to oppose the
Bush-DeLay-Frist triumvirate, he could have followed Senator Jeffords
and switched parties. He would have been welcomed. Unfortunately, he
must have believed his party's (rather un-American) rhetoric that the
Democrats were a permanent minority, and knew that under the Republican
reign, the minority would have no voice.

Nevertheless, Democrats owe Mr. Chafee a salute :

> "The American people have spoken out against the president's agenda on

> the Rhode Island moderate told The Associated Press.
> <p>
> "And at this late stage in my term, I'm not going to endorse something
> the American people have spoke out against."

Earth to Bush: Chafee is right, and has been right on a lot of things
where you've been wrong. Stop doing things that America doesn't want. If
you had listened, your party might not have taken such a "thumping."

Oh well. The Republican party is going to have to rebuild itself, and I
hope Chafee gets to play a role in that. I don't think the Republican
party deserves to be the majority party for a long, long time, but our
system is *supposed* to give the minority party a meaningful role in
government. Everyone would benefit if the GOP was dominated by
principled conservatives, instead of corrupt, cowardly and crazy
assholes. "Bipartisan" should mean "ideologically neutral." For most of
the last six years, it has meant GOP ideas with support from a few
particularly craven, power-starved Democrats.

Unless the GOP reforms itself, "bipartisan" is going to mean a
Democratic idea tempered with concessions to nutcases. I'd rather have
Democratic ideas tempered by conservative ones. You know -- legislation
that is the product spirited of debate, deliberation and careful
weighing pros and cons. Whoever is in control, you can't have a serious
debate, or the ideologically neutral legislation that comes from serious
debate, without a willingness on both sides to play fair.

Chafee is one of the few Republicans that knows how to put
doing-the-right-thing ahead of winning. But in January, he's gone.
Hopefully there are others in among the smoldering remains of his party
that will follow his lead, and play a constructive role by keeping
conservative ideas part of the legislative debate.
