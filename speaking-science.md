Summary: 


One of the projects I've been working on this semester is designing a
teaching unit for the UC Davis introductory biology curriculum. The
introductory biology courses are required for a whole bunch of different
majors at UC Davis, so all three of them are offered every quarter. It's
a huge effort, and thousands of students take these classes every year.
This is part of a teaching seminar led by Scott Dawson (don't bother
Googling for him -- you'll find the wrong guy). The idea behind Scott's
seminar is to take the half-dozen or so concepts that the BIS2A, 2B and
2C students struggle with, design teaching units aimed at those topics,
and then try them out on volunteers. My topic is stochastic processes,
which has been great fun. The project isn't finished yet, so I'll save
the details for later.

One of the other issues we've been addressing in the seminar is how
scientists relate to non-scientists. This is, for obvious reasons, an
essential teaching skill. Even if they hope to be scientists someday,
students are not scientists. If you don't find a way to talk with them
about science, then you're wasting their money and their time.

The idea that the educator is largely responsible for the success (or
failure) of the student hasn't really seeped into higher education,
although it's been the standard thinking in primary and secondary
education for decades. Not all elementary school teachers are good at
what they do, but it is generally agreed that if they are good, the
results will be seen in the subsequent success of their students. In
higher education, things don't really work this way.

The most often cited reason for poor instruction at the college level is
that many professors consider teaching secondary to their research.
While this is clearly true in many cases, teaching in higher education
doesn't just suffer from playing second fiddle to research. Many, many
professors (even whole departments) who take teaching seriously are
nevertheless not very good at it.

There are two causes, both of which are systemic problems. First of all,
people who teach at the college level are usually not trained as
teachers. Many (most?) professors have no education training whatsoever.
Yet, even if you have natural skills, teaching isn't something you can
do effectively without at least a little theory and training.

The result is that most of the teaching in colleges is done by amateurs
and autodidacts. In contrast, at the primary and secondary level,
teaching has been a job for trained professionals since the turn of the
last century.

The second problem, which is partly a symptom of the first, is regular
old-fashioned chauvinism. It is the responsibility of the student to
learn, but many professors fail to see how they fit into this. This
might be acceptable at a private, endowment-supported institution, but
such places are exceptions. The Harvards and Oxfords of the world are
free to treat their students however they like, but public institutions
are ultimately responsible to the taxpayers. The taxpayers support such
institutions for two reasons; to conduct research, and to educate their
kids. Sink-or-swim pedagogy is a dereliction of duty.

This is a problem that extends far beyond the classroom. I was listening
to NPR on the drive down to Los Angeles, and caught a story on *All
Things Considered* about the [reception of Darwin's *On the Origin of
Species*](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120751039).
Some extracts :

I think the good professor is missing the point. The problem is not
simply that science has gotten more complicated and technical. It is
true that there is more of it, and that it moves faster. The reason I
don't buy Dr. Shapin's argument is that this is not at all unique to
science. *Everything* moves faster and is more technical now than in
1859, and people seem to cope just fine.

The problem is that scientists do not spend enough time talking with the
general public. Only a small minority of scientists take the trouble to
arrange their findings in a form digestible by the lay audience, as
Darwin did. When they do, it is almost never cutting-edge research that
fills the pages. Very few scientists go on television or the radio. The
practice today is to bring research to lay the audience only when it is
neatly tied up (or, the research community feels that it is, anyway).
There are those who do otherwise, but there is a negative stigma to it;
scientists who announce their findings with press releases instead of
peer-reviewed papers are usually regarded with suspicion.

Darwin's target audience for *Origin* -- the typical educated Briton in
1859 -- would not have much of an advantage on the average American in
2009. A Victorian gentleman would probably have had better handwriting
and more patience for trudging through elliptical turns of phrase than
an American high school graduate, but I don't think they would have much
of advantage when it came to comprehending an unfamiliar scientific
topic. The advantage Darwin's audience had was that it had Darwin.

When a good teacher notices that a student is failing to learn
something, they will look first at their own teaching methodology for
the problem. The same goes for scientists; when the general public
doesn't understand or care about a scientific topic, a good scientist
should look first at how they are publicizing their work. If the public
doesn't think your research is important, then either you aren't
explaining it well enough, or maybe it actually isn't very interesting.
