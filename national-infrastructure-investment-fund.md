Summary: 


There were a lot of remarkable things about Obama's campaign, but one of
the most significant aspects is that it was funded by millions of
ordinary people who could only muster small donations. I've been
thinking a lot about how that model could be turned bigger problems.
Here's what I've come up with so far.

Most people set aside part of each paycheck for a variety of things.
6.2% of each paycheck (up to \$102,000) pays for contributions to Social
Security, 1.45% goes to Medicare. Then there is income tax withholding,
contributions to 401k plans, health plan co-payments, and so on. I think
we should create an additional voluntary withholding item with a
variable rate that would feed into a fund that invests in revenue
generating national infrastructure.

The idea is to offer taxpayers an investment option with a risk profile
somewhere between Social Security (which is designed to be a sure thing)
and a 401k (which can be lost completely). Contributions would be
invested only in critical national infrastructure projects, like
transport and renewable energy. The investments would be structured so
that they would pay dividends. For example, the fund could build wind
turbines, and the dividends would come from the electricity revenue.

This would help solve three problems :

-   It would give taxpayers a relatively safe investment option. The
    dividends might fluctuate from year to year, but the investment
    could never be lost. This would provide a nice compliment Social
    Security and a 401k.
-   It would create a pool of money designated for projects of crucial
    national importance. The fund would be big enough that it could
    invest on a scale impossible for private equity. Also, the focus on
    generating long-term reliable revenue instead of capital gains would
    allow the fund to invest on a much longer time horizon than most
    private equity.
-   It would bring patriotism, volunteerism and ecological-mindedness
    into alignment with individual financial self-interest.

I suppose similar things exist in the private sector already, mainly in
the form of green mutual funds and suchlike. I've never been very
impressed with them. Mutual mostly seem to focus on capital gains, which
seems like a crummy way of monetizing basic infrastructure like
electrical generating capacity. These funds are also generally very
small, which means they cannot invest directly in projects and they have
high overhead expenses.

I'm not interested in yet another speculative investment option. The
private sector does a good job there, and doesn't need to be duplicated.
I'm thinking of a different sort of model, more like social
entrepreneurism, but with mass-participation.
