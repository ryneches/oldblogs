Summary: 


I was reading [Planet Gnome](http://planet.gnome.org), and followed
Pascal Terjan's post to the [PyPy
project](http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/home.html), and decided
to play around with it. I've been studying for midterms all day, and
this looked like a mildly educational way of goofing off for half an
hour.

After the initial amusement running some of my python code in a python
interpreter written in python and running in another python interpreter,
it occured to me that there is absolutely no way I could articulate why
I think this is cool to someone who didn't already think it was cool.

Yet it is, nevertheless, kind of awesome.
