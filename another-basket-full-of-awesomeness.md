Summary: 


As it happens, I was wondering whether or not I should buy [the latest
version of
Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/products/mathematica/newin6/) when I
discovered a fantastic free tool tool that does most of the things I
want from Mathematica. [Maxima](http://maxima.sourceforge.net/) and it's
predecessors have been around longer than I've been alive, but I had no
idea that there were usable GUIs for it. I find it damn near impossible
to see what's going on in a mathematical expression unless it's typeset
properly.

So, I've always avoided Maxima because it doesn't have an interface, or
so I thought.

There is a fantastic little emacs lisp module called
[Imaxima](http://members3.jcom.home.ne.jp/imaxima/Site/Welcome.html)
that renders Maxima output in LaTeX and embeds it into an interactive
emacs mode. So far, I like it much more than Mathematica 5's bizarre,
ugly and schizophrenic Motief interface. Admittedly, I haven't yet tried
Mathematica's new QT interface, but I suspect it will probably be
nicer-looking but more complicated. I prefer simple and direct, and
Imaxima is just that.

And yes, after doing a bunch of machine-assisted algebra, you can make
interactive 3d color plots directly from emacs. Yes, emacs really does
do [everything](http://emacsmp3player.sourceforge.net/)<a>.
