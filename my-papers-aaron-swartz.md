Summary: 


This past Friday, I was enjoying a dinner party with some friends in
Brooklyn. Elsewhere in Brooklyn, Aaron Swartz, a fellow I have long
admired, hanged himself after two years of being stalked, bullied and
harassed by those we employ to Serve and Protect. He was being
prosecuted for downloading a bunch of academic papers. Papers to which
he had legal access, and whose content was overwhelmingly funded by
taxpayers. His "crime" was that he downloaded a lot of them, although
the publisher imposed no particular limit on how many he could download,
and that he downloaded them from a network he perhaps didn't have
permission to use. The "victims," JSTOR, the publisher, and MIT, the
owner of the network, were not the least interested in pursuing either a
civil or criminal case against Aaron.

Perversely, the Department of Justice and the Secret Service thought
otherwise. The US Attorney's Office was about to go to trial with
charges that would have resulted in thirty years of imprisonment were
Aaron convicted, but I can't imagine that Aaron hanged himself because
he was afraid.

Aaron was a [patriot and a
humanitarian](http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2013/01/aaron-swartzs-politics.html).
He was dedicated to the work of delivering a dose of integrity to the
institutions of democracy, even as those very institutions crushed him
for... for what, exactly? Sport and amusement, it seems. The People's
case against Aaron Swartz, [as represented by US attorney Carmen
Ortiz](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/technology/aaron-swartz-internet-activist-dies-at-26.html),
only makes sense if the People are sadistic bullies. It's hard not to
[wonder if Carmen Ortiz was planning to run for elected
office](http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2012/12/07/patrick-reportedly-cites-prosecutor-vying-for-governor/0aEpGj5QqjvJfgSwgFNc7H/story.html),
and if so, it's impossible to see Ortiz' case against Aaron as anything
other than a cold-blooded gambit for future campaign donations from the
media and publishing industries. Aaron's destruction was to be a signal
that Carmen Ortiz is tough on piracy. Grist for the mill of our
perfectly-legal political corruption.

That's not paranoia. That's politics in America. Aaron was deeply
committed to healing the necrotic tissues of America's democracy. Over
the last two years, reading about the case against him absolutely boiled
my blood, but it must have broken Aaron's heart. Perhaps he despaired
that America can be saved from the rot, or could no longer withstand the
pain and humiliation of being so ill-treated by the republic he cared so
much about.

As my tribute to Aaron, I've downloaded all of my own papers and posted
them here. Since joining [Jonathan
Eisen's](http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/) lab, I've been publishing
in Open Access journals, and so the two most recent papers are perfectly
legal for me to post here. The first three were written before I worked
for an advisor who understood what is really at stake in scientific
publishing, and so they are not open access. Here they are anyway. For
Aaron.
