Summary: 


One of the wonderful things about web applications is that they can be
available 24-7. They can sit there and quietly do their jobs -- taking
orders, billing credit cards, assigning work orders, or whatever -- even
when the office is empty. That's one of the main reasons one would go to
the trouble of putting a web front end on something in the first place.

So, the question of the evening is, does the UC Davis registrar know
this?

Um... no.

This is a completely automated process. If you do this during the
daytime, it just goes ahead and populates a table in whatever chthonic
legacy database system that is swaddled in this blob of early 1990's
vintage web programming. It's not like having the office open at the
time actually helps.

*Attention Amazon.com shoppers! It's 4:45 Central Time, and Amazon.com
will be closing for the day in 15 minutes! Please complete your order
before the site is disconnected for the evening. We will open again
tomorrow at 8:30 A.M. Thank you for shopping at Amazon.com!*

On the upside, at least it doesn't complain that my browser isn't
supported. Yay.
