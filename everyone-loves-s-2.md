Summary: 


The Democrats have launched their [first ten
bills](http://democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/record.cfm?id=267177&) as
the the majority party in Congress. They are all excellent proposals,
but I love S. 2, which will raise the minimum wage to \$7.25 an hour,
because it is a great idea and yet completely uncontroversial. That is,
for everyone except [crazy
idiots](http://democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/record.cfm?id=267177&) like
George Will at the Washington Post, who think the minimum wage should be
abolished.

Really? I mean, *Really?* Why does Mr. Will pine for the good old days
of the 19th century? There is really only one coherent
criticism of the Federal minimum wage that has survived scrutiny; that
it is a floor without a ceiling, and therefor helps to institutionalize
inflation. However, the minimum wage is so low that the aggregate
purchasing power of all people at or near the minimum plays and
insignificant role in inflation -- and even raising it to \$7.25 won't
change this. Although fewer in number, the wealthy command much greater
aggregate purchasing power, and thus play a larger role in inflation. If
we really treated labor as a commodity, then we should also have a
Federal *maximum* wage.

But of course, this is America. Every economic policy needs to be
attached to some sort of appeal to the emotions. This is exactly what
George Will is doing; his is encouraging the reader to join him in
waxing nostalgic for the simpler days of buggy whips and gas lamps,
before everything got so damn *political*.

Evidently, poor Mr. Will was denied a proper education. The decent and
proper thing to do would be to take up a collection so he can attend a
few introductory history and economics classes at his local community
college.
