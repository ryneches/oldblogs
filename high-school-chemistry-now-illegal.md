Summary: 


People wonder what is wrong with elementary and high school education in
America. Yet, if one is interested in discovering the cause of the
decline in the quality of education, one need not look beyond the things
we endeavor to keep out of the hands of students. Whether it is because
we deem such things offensive, dangerous or "too hard," by denying
students and teachers access to the tools, ideas, data and literature
necessary to explore the world, we are smothering students.

To wit, it looks like the [Consumer Product Safety
Commission](http://www.cpsc.gov/) is trying to outlaw high-school
chemistry. They have filed an [criminal
case](http://www.unitednuclear.com/legalaction.htm) against a number of
chemical suppliers, including one of my favorite companies, [United
Nuclear](http://www.unitednuclear.com), with the aim of banning the sale
of such things as powdered aluminum, powdered zinc, sulfur, nitrate
compounds, and a number of other basic compounds and elements, to anyone
without an ATF explosives manufacturing license.

Biology teachers have to watch their backs when they teach evolution. If
they want to talk about general relativity, or pretty much anything that
came along after Issac Newton, physics teachers share with biology and
history teachers the sticky "the Earth can't possibly be 6000 years old"
problem. English teachers have to watch their backs when they teach
[banned](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/People/spok/most-banned.html) authors
like John Steinbeck, Vladimir Nabokov, Mark Twain and James Joyce. Even
*James and the Giant Peach* can get you in trouble. Math teachers can
land themselves in hot water with the DMCA by teaching [certain
interesting applications of set
theory](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/DeCSS/Gallery/hannum-pal.html). And,
of course, history teachers can get themselves sacked or reprimanded (or
at least hauled in front of a PTA court martial) by mentioning such
subversive topics as...

-   ...the actual estimated age of the Earth and the means used to
    calculate it
-   ...how many Arawaks were murdered and mutilated by Christopher
    Columbus
-   ...the public campaign of multiple genocide carried out by the U.S.
    Army against several groups Native Americans, including the Sioux
    (Wounded Knee), Cheyenne and Arapaho (Sand Creek), and many others
-   ...the fact that Native Americans are most closely related to
    Asians, not Jews (contrary to the assertions of [certain
    folks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_latter_day_saints))
-   ...the idea that Japan may have surrendered to the Allies without
    the use of nuclear weapons and without an invasion of the Japanese
    home islands
-   ...evidence and analysis indicating that the campaign of strategic
    bombing in World War II had little impact on the war-fighting
    ability of the targeted nations, and that it constituted
    counterproductive terror tactics
-   ...America's role in sponsoring murder and totalitarianism in South
    America
-   ...the propensity of some 20th century American policymakers to
    endorse, sponsor and aid totalitarian regimes in general, and the
    affinity of these policymakers for the ideals of these regimes
-   ...that even as late as 2003, there was still [a segregationist
    politician in the U.S.
    Senate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strom_Thurmond)
-   ...the ineffectiveness of Wars on \$idea or \$inanimate\_object,
    with the occasional exception of the failure of Prohibition

Or, for that matter, history teachers can get themselves
[sued](http://www.downhillbattle.org/eyes/) for showing bootleg copies
of [Eyes on the Prize](http://pbsvideodb.pbs.org/resources/eyes/).
Practically the only way to stay out of trouble, if you're teaching
history, is to deliberately mis-educate your students by using one of
the textbooks reviewed in James W. Loewen's *[Lies My Teacher Told
Me](http://www.uvm.edu/~jloewen/liesmyteachertoldme/liesmyteacher.html)*.

Or, for that matter, if your school happens to be hosting an event for a
beverage company, students and teachers might also want to avoid wearing
clothes [carrying the logos of competing beverage
companies](http://www.fadetoblack.com/sellingout/). Just, 'cause... you
know. It would be disrespectful.

So now it seems that Chemistry teachers are on the list as well. No
longer will students be able to perform or observe many titration
reaction labs, or watch their teachers demonstrate the relative
properties [iron an aluminum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermite).
Model rocketry would seem to be banned as well. Just how far-reaching
the effects of this action remains to be seen.

Maybe they will ban simple [bomb
calorimeters](http://scitoys.com/scitoys/scitoys/echem/echem.html#bomb)
too, because... you know. They probably have the word "bomb" written on
them somewhere. It would be laughable, except that it has [already
happened](http://www.scitoys.com/scitoys/scitoys/echem/police_report.html).

And we wonder why our children aren't learning.
