Summary: 


Now that she's all [graduated and
stuff](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rneches/3540149080/), Mimi came out
to Davis for my birthday this week. She took me to this place in Napa
called, of all things, Ubuntu. Not only is it a nice word in Zulu, but
it's also a Linux distribution, a [restaurant *and* a yoga
studio](http://www.ubuntunapa.com/%0A). Anyway, they were the runner up
for [best new restaurant of
2008](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/19/dining/19two.html) in the New
York Times Food & Wine section.

It was delicious, but kind of difficult to describe. Evidently, the chef
walks out into his garden each morning, peers at the ripening
ingreedients, and invents the day's menu based on what's ready to eat.
Neat!

Anyway, Mimi is here in Davis until Friday. We're having a great time
biking around town and doing Davis-y things.
