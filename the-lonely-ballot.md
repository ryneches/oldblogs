Summary: 


Evidently I was the only one in my district who noticed the Official
Sample Ballot that showed up in my mailbox a few weeks ago. When I
walked into the the building (a Goodwill donation center near my
apartment), the poll workers regarded me with astonishment and
bewilderment. "Can I... Can I help you?" one of them asked.

It was well past noon, and they'd been there since 8:00. Besides the
five of them, I was the first voter to arrive. They'd been drinking
soda, telling stories and playing cards all day. I inked my ballot,
dropped it into the scanner thingy. I could actually hear it go *thunk*
into the empty plastic bottom of the ballot box.

I live in a very crowded West Los Angeles district; by population alone,
I'd guess that there are a few thousand people assigned to my polling
place.

On Sunday, I handed out fliers at an Albertsons grocery store for
Bennett Kayser, who is running for the school board (Bennett and Peggy
Kayser are old family friends). Almost everyone I spoke with -- about a
thousand people -- was surprised to learn that there was an election
coming up. Not a single person remembered receiving a sample ballot.
Evidently, [my observations weren't
anecdotal](http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-lausd7mar07,0,4466792.story?coll=la-home-headlines):

Depressing. California has too many damn elections.
