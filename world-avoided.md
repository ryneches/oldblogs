Summary: 


NASA's [Earth Observatory](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/) posted [a
fantastic
article](http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/WorldWithoutOzone/)
yesterday about [a big computation effort led by Paul
Newman](http://www.atmos-chem-phys.org/9/2113/2009/acp-9-2113-2009.html),
a scientist at the Goddard Space Flight Center. Newmans's group set out
to answer the question, "What would have happened if we had failed to
regulate CFC gases?"

CFC gases were essentially banned in 1989 through [the Montreal
Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Protocol), the world's
first international environmental treaty of global scope. So, what did
we avoid by banning CFCs?

Newman's group found that we avoided a previously unanticipated runaway
cascade of ozone depletion, which would have led to a nearly complete
loss of UV protection over the temperate and tropical regions -- not
just over the poles.

By the end of the collapse, the UV index would have exceeded 30 in
temperate North America. A [UV
index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV_Index) greater than 10 is
considered extremely dangerous.

We're talking about radiation levels similar to Hiroshima in the days
following the atomic bomb (though at a different spectrum), except
*across the whole planet*, every single day, for centuries. A walk on
the beach on a sunny afternoon would have been permanently disfiguring,
and possibly lethal.

Instead of this hellish scenario, CFCs peaked around the year 2000, and
they're already down about four percent. The simulations predict that
the ozone layer should finish healing by about 2065. Sweet.

We saved the world, at least from that particular disaster. What did we
sacrifice? Basically, nothing. We had to switch to different
refrigerants, and it took a few years before people figured out how to
make air conditioners that worked as well as the old ones. It might even
have been a net positive for the economy, since it accelerated
engineering innovation and equipment upgrades, and thus efficiency.

Carbon dioxide is going to be a bigger challenge. We emit a lot more
carbon than CFCs, and the things we do that emit carbon are, for the
most part, much more fundamental to our economy than running
refrigerators and air conditioners. Nevertheless, the Montreal Protocol
is a valuable lesson. It shows that politics *can* influence the world
in positive ways, even when everything is a mess. 1989 was not exactly a
banner year for political stability, good leadership, or economic
strength.
