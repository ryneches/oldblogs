Summary: 


To steal the [idea from John
Scalzi](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2010/05/09/the-last-picture-of-the-40-year-old-me/),
here is the last photograph of me in my 20s.

My twenties; better than my teens. Some good times, and some pretty
awful times, and on average kind of meh. If the trend holds, my thirties
should be in the tolerable to nice range. Hopefully the underlying
process is geometric, and not linear or logarithmic.

Hence the awkward sort of half-smile.
