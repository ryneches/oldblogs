Summary: 


I've been trying and failimg to get to sleep. The average interval of
cat bombardment, and the mean momentum of the incident cat field has
been unusually high. It took me a while to realize that this was related
to the weather; it is lightly sprinkling. My cats have never seen rain.

That's a sobering thought in two ways. On one hand, they are old enough
to have very well developed personalities, and yet are younger than the
Obama administration by several months. On the other hand, it's been
that long since it rained.
