Summary: 


To my surprise, I learned this weekend that Davis has a lively
population of [burrowing owls, *Athene
cunicularia*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrowing_Owl). How cool is
that?

I took some [nice
shots](http://www.flickr.com/photos/rneches/4400672818/), but
[Jonathan](http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/) has a 300mm zoom, and I
don't.

They're one of the few species of owl that is active during the day,
though I think these guys were only awake to watch various chattering
bipeds on the hiking trail. They seem comfortable with people getting
within about 30 feet of their burrows, so you can get pretty close. If
you go any closer, they start to do the "I don't like you" dance. If you
ignore the display and keep getting closer, I'm not sure if they would
run into their burrows or have at you with their claws and beaks. Owls
will mess you up, even these little guys. At least they're polite enough
to warn you, so heed the warning.
