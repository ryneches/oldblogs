Summary: 


In February, NOVA aired a program about [Percy
Julian](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/julian/), which you can now watch
online. Julian was a chemist who invented synthesis processes for a
number of medically important compounds (e.g., cortisone). He also
developed processes for economically synthesizing various human hormones
from vegetable sources, like Mexican yam and soybeans.

Julian's discoveries were crucial in synthesizing affordable birth
control medications and treatments for arthritis. He also blazed a path
into academia and the physical sciences for African Americans.
