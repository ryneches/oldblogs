Summary: 


[Here is what one New Orleans family
did](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/23/us/nationalspecial/23katrina.html?ex=1313985600&en=d7e198de7b9bf9b0&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss)
with a \$120,000 flood insurance payout. As heartening as this story is,
I'm sad to see that it's notable for being unusual. Instead of a
reconstruction effort, we have a feeding frenzy for Halliburton and
General Dynamics. New Orleans is still a moonscape, and there is still a
diaspora of refugees spread across the country.

They should fire whoever is in charge of the reconstruction, divide the
city into small zones, and put each one under the management of locals
like Artie Folse.
