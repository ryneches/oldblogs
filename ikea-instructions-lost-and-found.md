Summary: 


Figuring out how to reassemble IKEA products is probably a common
problem for people when moving. Fortunately, if you threw away the
instructions, you can always [download them again from the IKEA
website](%0Ahttp://www.ikea.com/ms/en_US/customer_service/assembly_instructions.html).

Now, the only problem remaining is to remember the unpronounceable
Swedish product name.
