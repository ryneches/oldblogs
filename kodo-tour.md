Summary: 


I went to see [Kodo](http://www.kodo.or.jp/news/index_en.html) at the
Mondavi center this Wednesday. I've been listening to Kodo since *Mondo
Head* came out in 2001, and they just keep getting more awesome. I
especially enjoyed Yoshie Sunahata's solo, which I'd not heard before.

I cannot stress this enough: [*Go see this show if you
can.*](http://www.kodo.or.jp/oet/index_en.html)
