Summary: 


Now that it looks like the Pentagon is finally ready to use the Military
Comissions Act, I think it's important that we all get something
straight. Waterboarding is not "simulated drowning." It does not "mimic
the sensation of drowning." It is **actual drowning**. Just as you can
choke on a under-chewed wad of burger meat without actually choking
death, you can drown for a couple of minutes without expiring. It is
absolutely possible to kill someone in the process of waterboarding
them.

So yeah. It's torture. And we did that to some guy as part of an
investigation by the duely constituted authorities. America is in the
torture business, and it's official. The only question now is what sort
of paperwork has to be filed for torture-induced confessions to be
admissible in the tribunals, which by the way, are entirely under the
direction of the executive branch.

The only question is this: Can we be as good at show trials as the
Soviet Union? It's a challange, but I have great faith that us
dilligent, hardworking can-do Americans can put together the most
justice-y show trial yet.
