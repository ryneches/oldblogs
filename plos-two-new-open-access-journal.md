Summary: 


People surely suffer worse injustices than the denial of instantaneous
access to the latest scientific research. Nevertheless, this particular
habit lacks a feature common to most unjust practices; that one party
benefits at another's expense. The restriction of access to basic
research hurts absolutely everyone. It's throwing sand in the gears of
the engine of progress. We can debate about whether it is more apt to
call it a spoonful or a truckload, but the damage is clear.

One might suppose that publishers benefit from the system of
closed-access journals, but this cynical view exaggerates the importance
of the relatively paltry sums of cash involved and disparages the value
of scientific and technological progress. Publisher's cannot cure their
cancers by wallowing in hoarded journal papers, but posting the hoard on
the internet stands a fighting chance.

So, I'm exceedingly glad that Nature Publishing Group has elected to
step into the ring in the corner of this fighting chance by launching
*[Scientific Reports](http://www.nature.com/srep/index.html)*.

[noted](http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/01/06/new-journal-nature-one-launched-today/)
that in many important respects, *Scientific Reports* is a clone of
*[PLoS ONE](http://plosone.org)*.

It has not escaped our notice that as recently as 2008, *Nature's*
Declan Butler was
[sneering](http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080702/full/454011a.html) at
*PLoS* for the practice of "bulk, cheap publishing of lower quality
papers." I'm sure the powers that be at *Nature* were expecting quite a
few wry smiles at news of the launch.

Nevertheless, it's one thing to do the right thing when you're filled
with righteous light. It's another thing altogether when it makes you
look a bit silly. I'm as guilty as anyone for poking fun at *Nature*; as
soon as I heard the news back in January, I gleefully registered
[PLoSTWO.org](http://PLoSTWO.org), and have spent the last couple of
months plotting elaborate satire.

Now that they've launched, I must admit that the inaugural papers look
pretty interesting. You'd better get your jokes in while they're still
funny. This is not a case of *Nature* verses *PLoS*. In this fight, it's
*Nature* and *PLoS* in one corner of the ring, and ignorance on the
other. It is good news for everyone that *Nature* has learned from its
comrade-in-arms how to throw a better uppercut.

**Update July 1, 2011 :** While they evidently appreciated the humor,
PLoS regretfully asked me to take down PLoSTWO.org. Instead of just
letting it go dark, I'm going to (voluntarily!) transfer it over to them
once they think of something to do with it. For now, it'll point at the
PLoS ONE About page.
