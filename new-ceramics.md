Summary: 


I just retrieved my latest ceramics from the studio today, and I'm
really happy with how they turned out. This is the first four of a
series of twelve pieces glazed the same way, with a turquoise
underglaze, a vibrant blue topglaze, and a buff-mix claybody with an
aluminum oxide treatment.

This is my favorite piece, and the largest thing I've finished so far.
It holds about 1400 ml. It's a little big to eat out of, but a little
too small to really use as a serving bowl. I think I will use it mostly
as decoration, but it could make a nice serving basin for two people, or
maybe for serving a side dish, or something like that.

Now I have six more things to finish before the quarter is over!
