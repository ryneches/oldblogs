Summary: 


The [LA Times is
reporting](http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-ex-ucla121206,0,751718.story?coll=la-home-headlines)
that a database containing personal records of 800,000 UCLA students,
staff and faculty was breached. Not only was it hacked, but it took them
a year to notice.

> UCLA officials said the attack on a central campus database exposed
> records containing the names, Social Security numbers and birth dates
> -- the key elements of identity theft -- for at least some of those
> affected. The attempts to break into the database began in October

This is a somewhat ambiguous way of phrasing it. If "Nov. 21" is meant
to be November 2006, then it took UCLA a more than a year to notice what
was happening. If it was November 2005, then it took them more than a
year to fess up. Either way, it's disastrously incompetent.

As it often does, the LA Times takes the most stupid possible position
on the problem. Instead of criticizing UCLA for its incompetence, they
conclude that it is the "openness" of universities that lead to these
breaches.

This is so stupid it makes me see red. There is *no* conflict between
"the open sharing of ideas" and protecting people's social security
numbers. The LA Times is pushing the narrative that technological
progress is incompatible with privacy and free speech.

No, dipshits. *Incompetent database management* is incompatible with
privacy, and "the open sharing of ideas" has nothing to do with it.

The most infuriating thing about these breaches is that, for the most
part, universities and companies have no use for this data. The data
they *do* need is ineptly and haphazardly scattered around the
organization in dozens or hundreds of semi-formal databases, usually
replicated inaccurately and incompletely by hand on an ad-hoc basis. It
usually isn't the database that is actually important to the institution
that gets hacked; it's one of the little ones that was set up to solve
some side problem in an organizational backwater. Once those databases
are created, they always grow; institutional instinct is to always
collect *more* information, and to keep it as long as possible. It is
the marriage of proliferating, non-critical and ineptly administered
databases of sensitive information with institutional instincts about
record keeping is destroying our privacy.

The solution, I think, is more, not less "openness." Stop asking people
to register, sign in, or create an account in order to do trivial
things. I understand the need to associate people's social security
number with, for example, their payroll information, or their grade
transcripts. Hire professionals to build, administer and protect those
databases, and they can be as safe or safer than paper records. I do not
understand the need to place this information in databases used control
access to the gym, library, parking garages, et cetera. Anonymity and
physical security are the solutions to these privacy threats. It might
cost more to let the general public access those facilities, but I think
that is a small price to pay for limiting the number of targets for
would-be identity thieves.

**Update:**

It looks like I am among the 800,000 :

I guess I should be glad that I live in California, where they are at
least required to *tell* me when this shit happens.
