Summary:

 *Professor [Frank T.
Robb](http://www.umbi.umd.edu/comb/faculty-directory/robb/index.php),
University of Maryland*

Frank is the co-chair of the workshop, and is leading our expedition.
Frank is a regular in Uzon Caldera, and has made several expedition to
the site since 1995.

Frank has been studying thermophiles for around twenty years, including
their physiology, genomes, proteins, and ecology.

 *Professor [Albert
Colman](http://geosci.uchicago.edu/people/colman.shtml), University of
Chicago*

Albert is organizing the expedition this year, and has accompanied Frank
(and others) to Uzon several times. Albert was Frank's graduate student
back in the day.

 *Alex Merkel, Winogradsky Institute of Microbiology*

Alex graduated from Moscow State University, and is now a Ph.D.
candidate at the Winogradsky Institute of Microbiology in Moscow. He is
studying the functional diversity of methanogenic genes and culturing
methane producing microorganisms.

He is also secretly the [lead singer from
Coldplay](http://www.clashmusic.com/news/chris-martin-bemoans-success).

 *Anna Perevalova, Moscow State University*

Anna graduated from Moscow State University and obtained her Ph.D. from
Winogradsky Institute of Microbiology in Moscow. She is now a
postdoctoral researcher at Winogradsky. Her specialty is growing
extremely difficult organisms, and she also works with Alex on
methanogens.

 *Sarah Griffis, Caltech and University of Chicago*

Sarah is a senior at Caltech, and has been working in Albert's lab in
Chicago for the summer doing DNA extractions.

 *Bo He, University of Chicago*

Bo is a graduate student in Albert's lab; he studies the electochemistry
of cellular redox metabolism, particularly as it pertains to metal
chemistry. He did his MS at Chapel Hill on the kinetics of iron III and
hydrogen sulphide in sediment formation. It's nice to have someone with
a physical sciences background along for the trip!

And, of course, me.
