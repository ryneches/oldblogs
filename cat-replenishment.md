Summary: 


I hear the internet is running low on pictures of adorable cats. It's
raining outside in Davis today. Buzz seems to be hoping that I'll put
down the camera and stop playing with ISO settings, and rub his belly.
Either that, or he's mugging for the camera. It's hard to tell.

That is all.
