Summary: 


So, pretty much every race I cared about went the wrong way in
yesterday's election. Wesley lost the nomination for governor, Francine
Busby lost her gambit to take CA-50, and both ballot initiatives failed.
I guess that's what happens when only 28% of *registered* voters show
up. Lazy fucks. Maybe they should give out sometime more exciting that
those little "I Voted" stickers. Maybe T-shirts, or mugs or something.
