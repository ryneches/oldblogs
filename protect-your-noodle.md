Summary: 


Yesterday afternoon, my little sister was hit by a car while riding her
bicycle across the University of Oklahoma campus. She suffered
lacerations and abrasions to her face, lost a couple of teeth, and a
number other injuries. She also has a serious concussion. She is now
experiencing memory loss, disorientation, extreme nausea, and huge
amount of pain.

All of this is, in a sense, good news. She was very, very lucky, given
that she was not wearing a helmet. The prognosis is that she will
recover completely after some unknown amount of time. My mother flew out
to Oklahoma on the first available flight, and she'll be staying with
Anna at least throught next week.

She is an exceptionally smart girl, and she knows perfectly well how
important helmets are. When we were little, I witnessed her flip her
bike and pile-drive her head into the sharp point of the curb in front
of our house. She was not hurt, but her helmet nearly split in half. We
still have that helmet, even thought it is ruined. The seven inch long,
two inch deep gash across the crown makes it perfectly clear that Anna
would have died that day, had it not been for a geeky-looking early
1990s vintage Bell helmet. The very first serious email I ever wrote was
to thank Bell Sports for saving my little sister.

Now is not the time to wonder why she wasn't wearing her helmet
yesterday. Maybe she lost it, or maybe she figured she was only going to
ride a short distance, or maybe she didn't expect any cars on campus. We
may never find out, given that she doesn't remember the accident. For
now, we're focusing on when we can take her out of the hospital, and how
long it will take her to recover.

I am writing this here today to ask you, dear reader, to always wear the
proper safety equipment. Concussions are not funny. Shit happens.
Protect your noodle.

I am going to go ahead and shamelessly plug Bell helmets. Bell has been
making helmets since 1954, and they *invented* the modern bicycle helmet
in 1975. Bell saved my little sister once, so they've got my vote for
life. Buy a helmet, and make sure it is on your head whenever you so
much as *handle* a bicycle, in case you are overpowered by a sudden
uncontrollable urge to peddle around. In fact, buy two, just in case you
loose one, or for variety, or for the hell of it.

If you are wondering how to make bicycling safer, you can do two things.
Wear a helmet, and [bicycle
