Summary: 


I propose a ballot initiative to amend California's constitution to end
ballot initiatives. Who's with me?

I like the idea of a little direct democracy, but it if I'm going to be
expected to cast votes on these damn things all the time, then I want my
damn legislator's salary. The initiative process should be reserved for
extremely serious problems, like succeeding from the union if the
Republic gets overthrown by evil blob aliens, or whatever.

What should be proposed, exactly? What if initiatives needed to pass at
66 percent? Or maybe if we required that a third of all California
voters sign the petition to get it certified? *How do we get rid of
these damn things?*
