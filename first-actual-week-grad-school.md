Summary: 


When it rains, it pours! I've been hanging around all summer wondering
what to do with myself, and now suddenly there is a huge explosion of
activity. After a four day expedition to Davis to sign paperwork at
Graduate Studies, register for classes, look for a job, look for an
apartment, and get a sense of what it will be like to live here, I drove
back to Los Angeles for my cousin Nathalie's wedding (Sunday) and my
great aunt's 88th birthday (Monday). Both were beautiful. Then I packed
my car and drove back to Davis this afternoon.

Tomorrow, I have a job interview and tour for an on-campus job working
in one of the Department of Entomology greenhouses. Not quite as good as
a TA position, but it would pay for rent and get me outside and moving
around on a regular basis.

I still haven't found a place to live yet, but a very nice fellow from
my department is letting me crash on his living room floor until I do.
Classes were supposed to start Thursday, but evidently the professor for
that course isn't here yet.
