*This post is for August 11th, 2010*

Sarah and Albert managed to finish the DNA extractions last night, much
to everyone's relief. Early that morning, we were visited by another
bear, which we caught on video this time.

As we started packing up our gear, we got word that the helicopter would
be arriving to pick us up around mid-morning, rather than mid afternoon
as we had expected. A furious scramble to pack everything up began, and
Frank set off into the field alone to retrieve enrichment cultures that
we hadn't collected yesterday.

I tried my best to stay out of the way, since I had already mostly
packed up the day before (no great accomplishment -- I didn't bring much
in the first place). All of my samples were already safely stowed with
Albert's. In retrospect, I should have gone with Frank to help him, but
he vanished almost the instant we heard the thwak-thwak of the
helicopter coming over the caldera wall.

Just as we finished packing the helicopter, Frank came charging over the
ridge from Central Thermal Field carrying all the enrichment samples he
could find.

Amazingly, we only left a few things behind. A small digital camera, my
toothbrush, and a few enrichment samples that sank too deep into one of
the springs. Later on, Albert was able to retrieve the samples and the
camera by joining the workshop excursion. He did not retrieve my
toothbrush.

On our [flight

Karymsky volcano erupted again, again just as we flew past. It was a
majestic farewell indeed.

I really, really regretted having to leave Uzon. It was a privilege and
an honor to have gone, and to have gone with such company. In the next
weeks and months I will have to work very hard; perhaps a big enough
scientific payoff might justify a return trip. I certainly hope so!
