Summary: 


Normally, I really, really hate mornings. When my radio clicked on this
monring, it was in the middle of a country song. The first lyric that
came up was, "I'm so tired of Mr. Wrong, I'm gonna find me a Mr. Right."
That was the first time I've woken up laughing in years.

I'm going to fix myself a nice steaming cup of democracy.
