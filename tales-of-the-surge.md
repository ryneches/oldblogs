Summary: 


Tuesday, the *New York Times* ran [the
latest](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/20/world/middleeast/20surge.html?_r=3&hp=&oref=slogin&pagewanted=print&oref=slogin&oref=login)
in the series of bizarre articles claiming that the troop surge in Iraq
is working. The premise of the article rests on perhaps the weakest
justification for optimism I have ever read, anywhere.

> The security improvements in most neighborhoods are real. Days now
> pass without a car bomb, after a high of 44 in the city in February.
> The number of bodies appearing on Baghdad's streets has plummeted to
> about 5 a day, from as many as 35 eight months ago, and suicide
> bombings across Iraq fell to 16 in October, half the number of last
> summer and down sharply from a recent peak of 59 in March, the
> American military says.

Mein Gott! *Days* pass without a carbombing! Let us rejoice! The article
parrots this sickly good news, which is the best news the chefs at the
Pentagon can cook up from the year's putrid harvest. Need I remind you
that the *New York Times* is once again reporting Bush administration
numbers as if they were fact. That hasn't worked out so well for the
*Times* in the recent past, but here they are, doing it again.

Much of the fall in violence can probably be explained by successful
ethnic cleansing throughout Baghdad.

Why are they buying this pitiful, slightly-less-awful picture? Simple.
**They can't speak Arabic.** [Juan Cole](http://www.juancole.com/)
offeres a more complete picture of what's going on in the region, a
picture he is able to express thanks on an amazing ability called
"bilingualism." Actually, Cole is fluent in Arabic, Persian and Urdu and
reads some Turkish, according to his CV. Evidently, the *New York Times*
can't be bothered to make itself aware of what is reported elsewhere.
What sort of picture does Cole see in the Arabic media? It still looks
like a full-blown civil war to me.
