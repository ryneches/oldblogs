Summary: 


I received my buccal swab kit from the [National Marrow Donor
Program](http://www.marrow.org/). It took about three minutes to
prepare. It's about as hard as brushing your teeth.

I especially like the biohazard sticker for sealing the sample card.
Then, you just stick it in the mail.

They'll do the tissue typing, and (hopefully) add me to the database of
marrow donors.

Seriously, why haven't you signed up yet?
