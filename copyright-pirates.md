Summary: 


So, the Copyright Royalty Board [ruled in favor of the recording
industry's extortion of internet
radio](http://www.kurthanson.com/archive/news/041607/index.shtml#B_story).
As an big fan of [KCRW](http://kcrw.org), this makes me especially
angry. This ruling will pretty much put KCRW out of business; most of
their listeners are online.

Naturally, they are scrambling to get more people to subscribe to
support the service. If the Court of Appeals doesn't overturn the
ruling, I will not subscribe. Nor will I listen. I would rather see KCRW
disappear than see my contribution to public radio pissed away on
SoundExchange royalty extortion.

<p>
Intellectual property law in the United States keeps drifting farther
afield from its basis in constitutional law. All intellectual property
law in the United States is predicated on this special power of
Congress:

> The Congress shall have power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties,
> Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common
> Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties,
> Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States;
>
> ...
>
> <p>
> To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for
> limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their
> respective Writings and Discoveries;

This decision accomplishes *exactly the opposite* of "Progress of
Science and the useful Arts." Radio broadcasters are not required to pay
these extra fees, and internet broadcasting is the logical technological
advancement over radio. But then again, a great deal of America's
intellectual property law already does more to stifle Science and the
useful Arts than encourage it. This is just the latest example.

KCRW and other internet broadcasters can take another direction, though.
They could put a blackout on artists represented by SoundExchange. If
they do this, I will *gladly* support KCRW.
