Summary: 


My mom has been interested in energy conservation for a long time. She's
managed to take a pretty considerable bite out of her electricity and
gas usage by taking some very simple steps. Below, I've plotted her
energy use over the last couple of years. I was only able to find a
handful of bills, but it's enough to see the trend. The first big
reduction is just from minor adjustments in habits -- turning the lights
off when she leaves the room, and opening the blinds to use natural
light in the daytime. The second big reduction is from installing
compact florescent bulbs. That doesn't sound very exciting, but it cut
her electricity use by 50-70%. If you've been doubting that those sorts
of changes make a difference, seeing is believing.

This is, by the way, *without* any new appliances. She's still got a
washing machine and dryer that are almost as old as me, a non-EnergyStar
dishwasher, and a massive professional refrigerator that predates
EnergyStar altogether.

The most obvious place to start, of course, is the refrigerator, which I
estimate to be sucking down between 2.5 and 5 kwh per day. Or, at least,
that's what it would have used when it was new, so it could be as much
as 20% more than that. To maintain that nice downward trend, I've
advised her to trade up to a [Sun Frost
RF16](http://sunfrost.com/refrigerator_models.html), which absolutely
*crushes* the competition, using less than half a kwh per day. The most
efficient models from big brands use about three times as much. Also,
they're built right here in the USA, in Arcata, California.

The cost-benefit analysis for washer, drier and dishwasher isn't quite
as stark. The main reason for swapping those out are to save water and
gas. For gas, the easiest savings can be had by replacing the water
heater, and she's already got an awesome tankless water heater. For
water, toilets and outdoor watering are the main culprits. She has a
couple of dual-flush toilets on order, and a there are a bunch of rain
barrels staked in the driveway. They will be hooked up when the new rain
gutters are installed.

When that's all done, she'll be ready to push the trend line the rest of
the way down to the axes. Ultimately, solar is the way to go in southern
California, but as long as panels cost a couple of dollars per watt,
you'd be crazy not to do the easy stuff first. In any event, she wants
to have some excess capacity in her photovoltaic system. Someday, she
swears, she's going to have an electric car.
